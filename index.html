         <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
         <p>
            Arcus is a pen and paper tabletop role playing game (TTRPG). This system draws
            inspiration from a wide variety of tabletop, video game, and board game systems
            to deliver a balanced and simple, yet deep and tactical experience compared to
            other traditional tabletop RPGs. Arcus’ unique take on combat and character
            abilities make fights incredibly varied, team based, with great tactical depth
            and a high skill ceiling.
         </p>
         <p>
            If you like Divinity Original Sin 2, Baldur’s Gate 3, Gloomhaven, or Dungeons
            and Dragons 5e but wish the combat was more engaging - this might just be the
            TTRPG for you.
         </p>
         <p>
            Note: This is an unfinished ruleset and is still under development. Changes
            may occur regularly. All <strong><span class="wip"> yellow </span></strong> text is work that is under
            consideration for tweaks or changes - use with caution. All <strong><span class="avoid"> red
               </span></strong> text (not to be confused with <strong><span class="fort"> this red </span></strong>
            text)
            is unfinished work or ideas that need to be removed or completely reworked
            - should not be used.
         </p>
         <h2 id="How to Play">How to Play</h2>
         <p>
            Play runs very similarly to other TTRPG systems, the game master (GM) creates
            and describes the world, and the player characters (PCs) then say what they want
            their character to do. If the action the PCs wish to take involves some degree
            of difficulty, for example jumping a large gap or avoiding a rock fall, they
            must roll dice to determine if the actions result in success or failure. The GM
            then narrates what happens as a result of the PCs’ actions. Battles, adventures
            and entire stories can be told using this simple back and forth system.

            The difference between success and failure is not always clear cut. The degree
            of success and failure can depend on the difference between the roll result and
            the DC. This degree of success is determined entirely by the GM but should be
            consistent.

            GM) to be successful.
         </p>
         <p>
            Every 2d12 roll will add 2 modifiers to it. These modifiers will come from a
            creature’s attributes such as strength, dexterity, and intelligence - the same
            attribute can be used twice in the same roll. The attributes used for the roll
            will depend on the GM’s request based on the action being taken.
         </p>
         <h4 id="Examples">Examples</h4>
         <p>
            Let’s take a warrior with +3 strength modifier, +1 dexterity modifier, and +0
            perception modifier. If they want to take an action such as kicking down a door,
            the GM would ask them to make a “strength plus strength check”. This means the
            warrior will roll 2d12 as always and add their strength modifier twice to the
            roll (+6 total modifier bonus). If the warrior wants to pick a lock, the GM
            might ask them to make a “dexterity plus perception check” so the warrior will
            roll 2d12 and add their dexterity and perception modifiers to the roll (+1 total
            modifier bonus).

         <p>
            Advantage (Adv) and disadvantage (DisAdv) range from -3 (---) to +3 (+++) and
            can be applied to a roll/check being made. The table below describes what effect
            Adv and DisAdv have on a roll.

         <p>
            Sources of Adv and DisAdv vary greatly, such as attacking from high ground, or a
            benefit granted by an ability. You will only ever use 2 dice values to get the
            total for a roll.
         </p>
         <p>
            Adv/DisAdv is often displayed as a series of (+) or (-) signs in brackets and
            these cancel each other out. As an example, an ability grants a warrior Adv (++)
            on their next attack. Other circumstances, such as a cloud of smoke, mean that
            the attack also has DisAdv (-). This results in (++-) for the attack roll. The
            (-) then cancels one (+) to give the final result of (+) for the attack roll.
         </p>
         <h4 id="Critical Successes & Critical Failures">Critical Successes & Critical Failures</h4>
         <p>
            A critical success is when the 2 dice used for the roll result each have a value
            of 10 or more (double digits).
         </p>
         <p>
            A critical failure is when the 2 dice used for the roll result each have a value
            of 3 or less.
         </p>
         <p>
            Critical successes generally mean a success with some additional bonus - such as
            additional damage or beneficial results. Critical failures generally mean you
            fail the check regardless of the modifiers added and the DC. However, it is up
            to the GM to decide how they wish to handle it in their game - it should be
            consistent.
         </p>
         <h4 id="Inspiration">Inspiration</h4>
         <p>
            Throughout the game, players can earn inspiration points. This is gained either
            by certain traits (General: Inspiring), magic items, or most commonly as a
            reward by the DM for when a player does something really cool. A player role
            plays a speech well before a battle? Inspiration! A player thinks of a really
            clever way to get round a trap, but still comes down to a check? Inspiration!
            <br><br>The GM can give this inspiration directly to the action,
            or to the players to use when they see fit. This can then be used in a skill
            check or attack roll to give them Adv (+) where appropriate. Adv (+) is only a
            small buff to the roll but can still feel like a great way to be rewarded and
            can be given out to players quite liberally.

         <p>
            There are many ways to start making your character in Arcus and the rules should
            accommodate whatever fantasy character you wish to create (within reason). In
            particular, the race/creature you decide to be makes no difference to the
            capabilities of your character so there are no restrictions. You should still
            discuss with your GM what races there are and how being this race might affect
            your character’s life. Your race also shouldn’t give you any significant bonuses
            such as extra arms or the ability to fly, but you can discuss how to make it
            fair and realistic with your GM.
         </p>
         <p>
            Below are some suggestions on where to start, we recommend starting with 1. and
            going through our step by step guide, but you can read through each and find
            your preference.
         </p>
         <ol>
            <li>You could start by imagining up the flavour of character first - such as a
               cunning lizardman rogue with an obsession for doodling, or a proud steam powered
               golem paladin on a mission to find their creator, or a fun loving human mage
               with an affinity for protecting their friends and destroying things with fire.
               You’re looking for a main characteristic, a race, a class, and a goal. With this
               you can go through character creation starting with Attributes (step 2), working
               out which attributes, skills, traits, classes, and abilities best suit what you
               are trying to make.
            <li>You could instead start with the mechanics - what sort of playstyle you want
               to achieve, and what abilities you want your character to have. Do you want them
               to be a support role with healing and party boosting effects? Maybe look into
               Arcane or Mortality classes. Would you rather play as a brutish tank with crowd
               control and melee capabilities? Look into Warrior or even Elemental if you want
               to add a flair of magic. Go to the Classes section (step 5) first for summaries
               of each class and what they can help you create.
            <li>You could start with your character’s personality and backstory. Perhaps you
               want to write a story about how your character, a humble miller, daughter of a
               miller, becomes a warrior on a path for vengeance after her village is
               plundered. How this influenced her to be cynical about the world and distrusting
               of others - she’s had to become independent but now needs help and is struggling
               with the idea of attachment. Go to the Personality and History section (step 8)
               to get started with this stage of character creation.
            </li>
         </ol>
         <h3 id="Step 2 - Attributes">Step 2 - Attributes</h3>
         <p>
            Attributes outline your character’s core physical and mental capabilities. Is
            your character strong or weak? Fast or slow? Smart or simple? Confident or shy?
            These questions will help you work out your character’s attributes.
         </p>
         <p>
            There are 6 main attributes that all creatures and characters will have:
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong><span class="fort">Strength (STR)</span></strong> - a character's physical strength and brute
            force. In addition to strength based skill checks, your strength modifier (STR) can be used for all melee weapons,
            and to reduce incoming damage with a shield.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong><span class="fort">Constitution (CON)</span></strong> - a combination of the character's overall
            health and endurance. In addition to constitution based skill checks, your starting Hit Points are twice your
            consitution value. Additional HP increases are then based on your constitution modifier (CON).
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong><span class="refl">Dexterity (DEX)</span></strong> - a character's hand-eye coordination, balance,
            and overall grace. In addition to dexterity based skill checks, your dexterity modifier (DEX) can be used for light and
            medium melee weapons, thrown weapon attacks, and to increase you Armour Class (AC).
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong><span class="refl">Perception (PER)</span></strong> - a character's senses/awareness, ability to
            aim, and their instinctive ability to pick up on details. In addition to perception based skill checks, your perception
            modifier is used for ranged weapons and your initiative - how early you go in combat. 
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong><span class="will">Intelligence (INT)</span></strong> - a character's logic and reasoning
            capabilities as well as memory and knowledge. In addition to intelligence based skill checks, your intelligence modifer
            (INT) is used for some spells, and every additional modifier grants you an additional skill at (+) level.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong><span class="will">Spirit (SPI)</span></strong> - a character's mental resolve, confidence and
            creativity. In addition to spirit based skill checks, your spirit modifer (SPI) is used for some spells, and every 
            additional modifier grants you an additional resistance point of your choice.
         </p>
         <p>
            Attribute values commonly range from 10 to 20, where 10 roughly describes the
            average human capability, but can range from 1 to 30 in some creatures. The
            value of the attribute will generate a modifier that can be added to dice rolls.
         </p>
         <p>
            At level 1 you have a value 10 in each attribute and 16 points to put into them
            as you wish. At level 1 the max value you can have in an attribute is 15, and
            past level 1 the max is 20. For example, at level 1 you could make a character
            with 16 Strength, 14 Constitution, 16 Dexterity, 10 Perception, 10 Intelligence,
            and 10 Spirit.
         </p>
         <p>
            Below is a table of the attribute values and the modifier you will have based on
            the value.

            In some rare cases your GM may allow you to drop an attribute score below 10,
            but this should be for roleplaying purposes only - as 10 is already below
            average. You also cannot reduce your attributes in a way that would lead to you
            having negative resistance points (see next section).

            Resistance points are a resource that you will spend to prevent incoming

            your dexterity and perception - such as dodging an explosion of fire or a hail
            of arrows.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong><span class="will">Will (WILL)</span></strong> - the ability to resist negative effects using your
            intelligence and spirit - such as focusing your mind to avoid being manipulated
            by a spell, or having the confidence to not become frightened.

         <h4 id="How Many Resistance Points Do I Have?">How Many Resistance Points Do I Have?</h4>
         <p>
            Next calculate your resistance points from your attributes. To calculate how
            many you have, subtract 10 from each related attribute value, then add the two
            numbers together.

         <p>
            <strong><span class="fort">Fortitude (FORT)</span></strong> - your <span class="fort">strength</span> value
            -10
            added to your <span class="fort">constitution</span> value -10.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong><span class="refl">Reflex (REFL)</span></strong> - your <span class="refl">dexterity</span> value
            -10 added to your
            <span class="refl">perception</span> value -10.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong><span class="will">Will (WILL)</span></strong> - your <span class="will">intelligence</span> value
            -10 added to your <span class="will">spirit</span>
            value -10.
         </p>
         <p>
            For example, a character with 16 STR and 12 CON has 6 points in STR and 2 in
            CON, so has (6+2) 8 FORT resistance points.
         </p>
         <p>
            You also gain additional resistance points to assign as you wish equal to your
            SPI modifier. A creature with +2 SPI modifier will have 2 additional resistance
            points to assign as they wish, such as 1 extra FORT point and 1 extra WILL
            point. When your SPI modifier increases you may assign the additional resistance
            points freely.
         </p>
         <h4 id="How Do I Use Resistance Points?">How Do I Use Resistance Points?</h4>
         <p>
            There are 4 ways to spend resistance points:
         </p>
         <h5 id="Resisting Incoming Effects">Resisting Incoming Effects</h5>
         <p>
            The GM will tell you the recommended cost of resisting an incoming effect. To
            resist it you will choose how many resistance points to spend and then roll
            1d12. If you spend the recommended resistance points, reduce your current
            resistance points by the cost. If you spend one less than recommended you
            successfully resist on a 8 or higher, if you spend equal to the recommended you
            successfully resist on a 3 or higher, if you spend one more than recommended you
            automatically succeed. If you spend two less than the recommended resistance
            points or fail the roll you are inflicted with the condition.
         </p>
         <h5 id="Resisting Incoming Damage">Resisting Incoming Damage</h5>
         <p>
            You may negate a single instance of incoming damage by spending any 5 of your
            remaining resistance points. You can do this at any time and it does not cost a
            reaction.
         </p>
         <p>
            However, the GM may ask you to describe how you negate the damage. This gives
            the player an opportunity to describe the cool and heroic actions of their
            character to avoid the damage/effect. It also gives the GM the opportunity, in
            some very rare cases, to deny the damage reduction if it cannot make sense for
            the damage to the character to be negated, or come to a reasonable middleground.
            Such as if the player is <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>paralysed</a> 
            and suffers damage the player cannot negate
            the damage, but if it would kill them the GM can let the player drop to 1 HP and
            fall <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>unconscious</a> instead. 
            Or in even rarer cases such as being crushed by a wave
            of magma the player might have no chance of survival and die instantly. Note to
            GMs, don’t crush your players with waves of magma - that’s mean.
         </p>
         <h5 id="Empowering Your Abilities">Empowering Your Abilities</h5>
         <p>
            You may spend your resistance points to empower your abilities to make their 
            effects more likely to succeed. When you use an ability with an effect that costs resistance 
            points to resist, immediately before the creature attempts to resist, you may  
            spend up to 3 resistance points of any type to increase the resistance point 
            cost of the ability by the same number. If the ability can cause multiple effects 
            that cost resistance points to resist, you must spend additional resistance points 
            separately for each effect separately. For AoE abilities 
            you may do this to any creatures of your choosing in the AoE, but you must 
            spend resistance points for each creature separately.
         </p>
         <h5 id="Empowering Your Resistance Drain">Empowering Your Resistance Drain</h5>
         <p>
            When you use the Resistance Drain core ability on a creature, 
            you may spend up to 3 resistance points of any type to increase the 
            resistance points drained from that creature by the same number.

         </p>
         <h4 id="Important Notes For The GM">Important Notes For The GM</h4>
         <p>
            Enemies and creatures by default should not be able to spend resistance points to resist 
            damage. They also should not be able to use the resistance drain core ability, 
            spend resistance points to empower abilities, or spend resistance points to empower 
            their resistance drain.
         </p>
         <p>
            The player can choose not to spend their resistance points and save them for
            later effects or damage reduction etc. However, we strongly recommend  that the 
            GM's monsters and NPCs always spend the recommend resistance point cost -  
            if they have fewer available than the recommended cost they should still 
            always spend their resistance points even if it would have no effect. For example, 
            if the ability costs 5 FORT to resist, and the creature has 3 FORT remaining, it should 
            still spend all 3 FORT points as it fails to resist the effect. The creatures 
            may spend 1 extra resistance point to automatically succeed. This is done to 
            allow players to spend their abilities to weaken enemies by forcing them to 
            spend their resistance points and to avoid GM creatures metagaming, and avoid 
            confusion around enemies choosing not to resist effects.
         </p>
         <p>
            We also recommend that resistance points of enemies and creatures should be visible to the
            players. This ensures that the players can know whether or not their ability will
            have an effect before they use it. It adds a layer of consistency to
            combat and prevents players from being disappointed when their ability is
            unexpectedly resisted. You can perhaps do this in more vague terms rather than
            giving specific values depending on how you want to play. For example “the
            monster looks very tough and well fortified, but slow and unintelligent”, would
            mean the monster has high FORT but low REFL and WILL. We also recommend that 
            you inform players just before they use an ability that is unlikely to work because 
            the creature has many resistance points in that area.
         </p>
         <p>
            In general creatures will have far fewer resistance points than the players - this 
            is because creatures will only be using their resistance points for this encounter, 
            where the player's resistance points will need to last them the entire day. 
            Some bosses may have significantly more however. For example, most basic creatures will have 0 or 1 resistance
            points in at least 1 or 2 areas. These weaknesses should make sense based on the
            character and type the creature. A light and nimble bandit may have 4 REFL
            points and 0 WILL or FORT. While a spellcaster may have 4 WILL and 0 FORT or
            REFL.
         </p>
         <h3 id="Step 4 - Hit Points">Step 4 - Hit Points</h3>
         <p>
            Your Hit Points (HP) or Health at level 1 is equal to your CON Attribute value
            multiplied by 2. So a CON of 16 results in 32 HP at level 1.
         </p>
         <p>
            Every odd level after first (3, 5, 7, 9 etc.) you gain 10 plus your CON modifier
            in additional HP. So with the same CON value you’d have 32 at level 2, 45 at
            level 3, 58 at level 5, and so on.
         </p>
         <h4 id="Temporary Hit Points">Temporary Hit Points</h4>
         <p>
            Temporary hit points (Temp HP) last until the start of the turn of the creature
            that granted the Temp HP - unless stated otherwise. They act as normal HP but
            are always used before regular HP. You may have multiple sources of Temp HP and
            these should be kept separate -. the creature with the Temp HP can choose which
            pool is used first.
         </p>
         <h3 id="Step 5 - Classes">Step 5 - Classes</h3>
         <p>
            Every level a character has allows 1 point/level to be assigned to a class of
            their choice. Classes are either physical or magical and placing points in them
            allows a character to unlock abilities relating to that class. Putting levels
            into multiple classes is actively encouraged, and there is no restriction or
            downside to which you choose and the order in which you progress in them.

            Then for class abilities see the <a href="#Class Tables">Class Tables</a> section. 
            The first level assigned a class automatically gives the character all of the
            core abilities in that class (denoted by “Core” in the level column). They then
            choose 2 abilities to unlock and use, and every level after that unlocks 1
            additional ability. If you put a level in a class you must choose the abilities
            you unlock from that chosen class. You can choose new abilities from anywhere in
            the class equal or less than your level in that class. You cannot unlock an

            All abilities with an AP cost have 3 uses per long rest, unless “Core” is written

            Some abilities will have restrictions as to whether they can be done with ranged

            performed without a free hand. Therefore, you can wield weapons and cast spells
            at the same time. Each magical class also has 1 or 2 abilities that have

         <h3 id="Step 6 - Skills & Traits">Step 6 - Skills & Traits</h3>
         <p>
            Level 1 characters start with 4 skills or traits of their choice (explained
            below), each skill at a proficient (+) level and they must meet the requirements
            of the chosen traits. Every odd level after this (3, 5, 7 … 19) 1 additional
            point is gained to either spend on an additional skill proficiency level, or an
            additional trait.
         </p>
         <p>
            Characters also gain additional skills equal to their INT modifier. These can
            only be used to become proficient (+), and cannot be spent to become expert (++)
            or master (+++).
         </p>
         <h4 id="Skills">Skills</h4>
         <p>
            Skills are normally 1 or 2 words that describe something your character can do
            particularly well, regardless of the attributes needed for the task. Look at the
            Skill Ideas section below and consider the following questions when deciding
            what skills your character might have: What has your character grown up doing?
            What work have they done? What are they good at? What task might they be faced
            with that they can do better than most? You should always discuss with your GM
            what might be good skills to have, that aren’t too general or too specific.
         </p>
         <p>
            Each character will have a list of skills, each one ranging in degree of
            expertise:
         </p>
         <p>
            Proficient (+)
         </p>
         <p>
            Expert (++)
         </p>
         <p>
            Master (+++)
         </p>
         <p>
            The (+) notation describes the degree of Adv they will get on rolls/checks
            involving that skill. For example, the GM asks a warrior to “make a strength
            plus strength check to jump the gap”. The warrior is an expert (++) in athletics
            so they ask the GM if they can use their athletics for the check, the GM deems
            this appropriate and allows it. The warrior then makes the check with Adv (++)
            adding their strength modifier twice.
         </p>
         <p>
            The attributes used for the same skill may vary. For example if the same warrior
            as detailed above wants to run, jump, and duck past a couple of obstacles, the
            GM may ask them to “make a strength plus dexterity check to run and avoid the
            obstacles”. The GM will still allow the warrior to use their athletics skill,
            giving them Adv (++) on the roll and then adding their strength and dexterity
            modifiers.
         </p>

         </p>
         <p>
            This is just a list of skill ideas, this should not be taken as the definitive
            list of skills. Remember to discuss with your GM which skills you would like to
            have, and be accepting of adjustments that may need to be made to them so that
            they fit well in the world.

         <p>
            Traits are special abilities that can be found in the trait tables below. They
            are primarily non-combat abilities that add flavour and utility to a character or
            creature. Some also have specified requirements that a character must meet to be
            able to unlock the trait. Some are passive, while others are limited to 1 or 3
            uses.

                  You may spend an hour creating a magical symbol on the ground that is 10ft in diameter. 
                  This symbol will have a unique set of markings to identify it so it can be reused, as the symbol 
                  will remain until removed through magical means. It also remains visibly etched into the floor.
                  On completion you may immediately open a gateway to another teleportation symbol 
                  by using the target's teleportation symbol's unique markings. 
                  The gateway is open for 6 seconds and any number of creatures may pass through it in 
                  either direction - so long as they can fit through the 10ft gateway. 
                  You may alternatively use this ability to use a preexisting teleportation symbol and open a gateway, 
                  skipping the creation step. Using this ability in this way only takes 3 AP (6 seconds) to cast.

            Below are the details on all the potential weapons you might have. Weapons are
            fluid and can be reskinned in many ways - in theory you can think of any fantasy
            weapon and the rules should have a way of putting that into the game. Remember
            that you can wield weapons and cast spells at the same time (no free hand
            required) or go without any weapons and just use spells.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong>Weapon Properties:</strong> Light, Medium, Heavy, One-handed,
            Two-handed, Melee, Versatile, Ranged
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li><strong>Melee weapons</strong> have a range of 5ft, this means you have to
               be adjacent to the enemy to make an attack. Melee attacks will use STR or DEX
               depending on the weapon and the wielder’s choice.
            <li>All <strong>ranged weapons</strong> have DisAdv (-) on attacks made when
               there is a hostile creature within 5ft of you. Ranged only weapons will use PER,
               if the weapon is versatile it will use DEX to be thrown.
            <li><strong>Versatile weapons</strong> can be either used as melee weapons (STR
               or DEX) or as ranged (thrown using DEX).
            <li>There are 3 damage classes of attacks. These are <strong>Light, Medium, and
                  Heavy</strong>. This damage scales with level, and weapons with these
               characteristics have varying properties. See Damage section in Combat for damage
               values.
            <li><strong>Unarmed attacks</strong> are melee only, use STR or DEX to attack
               and deal Light damage. However you cannot add your modifier to the damage. They
               can be “dual-wielded”.
            <li><strong>Light Weapons</strong> are all one-handed. Light weapons are either
               melee, versatile or ranged. If they are melee or versatile they will use STR or
               DEX for melee attacks (wielder’s choice) and DEX for thrown ranged attacks. If
               they are ranged only they will use PER and have long range. All Light versatile
               and ranged weapons will have short range (25ft).
               <ul>
                  <li>Examples of <strong>Light melee</strong> <strong>weapons</strong>: fists or
                     knuckle dusters.
                  <li>Examples of <strong>Light versatile</strong> <strong>weapons</strong>:
                     dagger, handaxe, or an improvised weapon such as a brick.
                  <li>Examples of <strong>Light ranged</strong> <strong>weapons</strong>: hand
                     crossbow, blowdart, or a small firearm.
                  </li>
               </ul>
            <li><strong>Medium melee weapons</strong> are one-handed and can use DEX or STR
               to attack.
               <ul>
                  <li>Examples of Medium melee weapons: longsword, axe, or a mace.
                  </li>
               </ul>
            <li><strong>Medium ranged only weapons</strong> are all two handed, require PER
               to attack, and have long range (100ft).
               <ul>
                  <li>Examples of Medium ranged weapons: bow, crossbow, or an assault rifle.
                  </li>
               </ul>
            <li>Note: Medium weapons cannot be versatile.
            <li><strong>Heavy melee weapons</strong> are all two-handed and require STR to
               use.
               <ul>
                  <li>Examples of Heavy melee weapons: greatsword, greataxe, or a large club.
                  </li>
               </ul>
            <li>Note: Heavy weapons cannot be versatile.
            <li><strong>Dual wielding</strong> can be done with 2 Light weapons, or a Medium
               and a Light weapon. Both must be one-handed. Attacks that involve both weapons
               can make 1 attack roll against a single target - or split into 2 against
               multiple targets, such as melee attack with your main hand melee weapon then
               throw a dagger at a different target with your offhand. Damage is calculated as
               normal for the weapon in the main hand, and the off-hand weapon just adds base
               damage (no additional attribute bonus). Attack rolls while dual wielding with a
               Medium and Light weapon are calculated with a -2 modifier. Attack rolls while
               dual wielding 2 Light weapons are done as normal.
            </li>

            A summary of how the different weapons will work in the game - each weapon can
            be reskinned or flavoured to fit what you want your character to use. For
            example, you might use: knuckle dusters or a simple improvised weapon instead of
            a club; a handaxe, sickle or stiletto instead of a dagger; a rapier, scimitar,
            axe, mace, spear or short staff instead of a sword; a greataxe, greatclub,
            scythe or large spear instead of a greatsword; a crossbow or rifle instead of a
            bow; a blowdart or pistol instead of a light crossbow.

            A shield takes 1 hand to equip (your off hand), and grants an ability with
            unlimited uses. This ability can be used when you suffer any amount of damage,
            but only once per turn (does not use a reaction): It is reduced by your STR
            modifier in damage (minimum 0). This damage reduction occurs before any other
            damage reduction. Auto-hit attacks ignore shields.

         <p>
            All characters have their strengths and weaknesses, and in role playing both are
            equally fun. The following questions will help you determine your character’s
            personality - remember that every trait is a sliding scale where your character
            could be anywhere in between these extremes. Are they funny or serious?
            Optimistic or pessimistic? Sociable or quiet? Honest or deceptive? Kind or
            cruel? Passionate or stoic? Collaborative or independent? Open-minded or
            stubborn? Energetic or calm? Spiritual or material? Generous or greedy?
            Respectful or rude? Forgiving or vengeful? Modest or boasting? Creative or
            traditional?
         </p>
         <p>
            You can delve further by asking how your character might behave and react in
            different situations, and asking some more applied personality questions. Would
            your character offer to help someone for free or expect payment? If threatened,
            would your character seek a peaceful outcome or quickly resort to violence?
            Could your character forgive someone for stealing from them, or would they
            demand vengeance? How would your character react to being insulted? What type of
            shop or treasure interests your character? Do you have a role model? What are
            your character’s short and long term motives/goals? Are there any political or
            social views that your character strongly agrees or disagrees with? Are there
            any organisations in the world that your character strongly agrees or disagrees
            with? What are your character’s deepest fears? What are your character’s
            greatest values? What does your character do for fun?
         </p>
         <p>
            Questions to ask about your character’s history - also see the Skills and Traits
            section (step 5). Where is your character from? What is their family like - what
            have they done and where are they now? What major events have occurred during
            your character’s life so far? What have they done in response and how has it
            moulded your character into who they are now? How has that affected their
            motives? What secrets do they have? How did your character gain the attributes
            and class that they are now? Does your character have few or many friends? Are
            any of those friends notable, if so what are they like? What kind of people do
            you trust and mistrust? Does your character have any hobbies?

         <h3 id="Action Point System">Action Point System</h3>
         <p>
            All creatures have 3 action points (AP) to spend every turn. They are set back
            to 3 AP at the start of their next turn. However, some conditions and abilities
            may affect this. These action points can be spent on abilities/actions such as in the 
            <a href="#Core Ability List">Core Ability List</a> section, or class abilites from your class(es) 
            in the <a href="#Class Tables">Class Tables</a> section.
         </p>
         <h4 id="Reactions">Reactions</h4>
         <p>
            You gain a reaction at the start of your turn every round which can be spent on
            various abilities and attacks of opportunity. It can be spent at any point,
            either on your turn or during another creature’s turn.
         </p>
         <h3 id="Movement">Movement</h3>
         <p>
            Your base movement speed is 25ft. However, this can be affected by armour,
            abilities, and equipment. You can spend 1 AP to move up to your base movement
            speed. This movement can be broken up around the other things you do on your
            turn - for example with 25ft of movement you could move 10ft, then attack, then
            move the remaining 15ft.
         </p>
         <h4 id="Difficult Terrain">Difficult Terrain</h4>
         <p>
            It takes 10ft of movement instead of 5ft to move into a tile that is considered
            difficult terrain. Creatures can also move through allies as if they were
            difficult terrain. Creatures cannot move through other hostile creatures.
         </p>
         <h4 id="Types of Movement">Types of Movement</h4>
         <h5 id="Regular Movement">Regular Movement</h5>
         <p>
            Regular movement includes running, walking, and crawling. Generally referred to
            as “move” or “movement”.
         </p>
         <h5 id="Jumping Movement">Jumping Movement</h5>
         <p>
            Jumping movement works the same as regular movement except obstacles (such as
            gaps, low obstacles, or small creatures) can be avoided on the path. What can or
            cannot be jumped over is up to the GM’s discretion. The jump may require a roll
            depending on the distance or height of the jump - this will use strength and/or
            dexterity depending on the nature of the jump (strength for greater distance,
            dexterity for greater accuracy). Generally referred to as “jump” or “jumping”.
         </p>
         <h5 id="Climbing Movement">Climbing Movement</h5>
         <p>
            Climbing movement works the same as regular movement but is done up a more
            vertical surface such as up a wall or a tree. What can or cannot be climbed is
            up to the GM’s discretion. The GM will make the creature perform a skill check
            based on the difficulty of the surface they are attempting to climb. If
            successful the creature can climb as if the surface was difficult terrain. The
            creature must repeat the skill check every time it wishes to move its base
            movement speed - it is up to the GM if and when they may need to repeat the
            skill check based on time spent climbing or if the difficulty of the climb
            significantly changes.
         </p>
         <h5 id="Swimming Movement">Swimming Movement</h5>
         <p>
            Swimming movement works the same as regular movement but is done through a
            liquid such as water or slime. What can or cannot be swam through is up to the
            GM’s discretion. The GM will make the creature perform a skill check based on
            the difficulty. If successful the creature can swim as if the liquid was
            difficult terrain - it is up to the GM if and when they may need to repeat the
            skill check based on time spent swimming or if the difficulty of the swim
            significantly changes.
         </p>
         <h5 id="Teleportation Movement">Teleportation Movement</h5>
         <p>
            Teleportation movement allows a creature to move to a point they can see,
            ignoring all obstacles between their start and end point. Teleportation movement
            ignores all movement restrictions the creature might have (<a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>immobilised</a> or 
            <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>hobbled</a> specifically). Teleportation movement happens
            instantaneously and cannot be broken up throughout a turn. A creature can
            teleport to a point in mid-air. Generally referred to as “teleport”,
            “teleportation” or “teleported”.
         </p>
         <h5 id="Flying Movement">Flying Movement</h5>
         <p>
            Flying movement allows movement in all directions including directly and
            diagonally up and down. A creature can only fly if they have a flying movement
            speed. Some abilities or transformations can unlock a flying movement speed.
         </p>
         <p>
            A flying creature does not have to end its movement on the ground - it does not
            fall or take falling damage while flying. If the creature is knocked <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>prone</a> 
            or <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>stunned</a> 
            they are no longer flying and will immediately fall at 
            normal speed and take fall damage as normal - the creature becomes flying again
            when it spends flying movement speed. Generally referred to as “fly”, “flight”
            or “flying”.
         </p>
         <h5 id="Voluntary Movement">Voluntary Movement</h5>
         <p>
            Movement is considered voluntary if the creature has a choice of how it moves
            and where. Most movement is considered voluntary. For example, base movement, or
            movement gained from a creature’s own abilities or ally’s abilities.
         </p>
         <h5 id="Involuntary Movement">Involuntary Movement</h5>
         <p>
            Movement is considered involuntary if the creature does not have a choice of how
            it moves and where. For example, a hostile pulling, pushing, or teleporting
            another creature, or any movement effect on a creature that it can attempt to
            resist. Movement due to being <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>taunted</a>, <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>frightened</a>, or
            <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>dominated</a> is still considered voluntary movement.
         </p>
         <h5 id="Push/Pull Movement">Push/Pull Movement</h5>
         <p>
            Push/pull movement is always involuntary and ignores difficult terrain and
            movement restrictions the creature might have (<a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>immobilised</a>,
            <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>paralysed</a>, or <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>hobbled</a> specifically) unless the GM
            deems it unreasonable. Generally referred to as “push”, “pushed”, “pull”, or
            “pulled”.
         </p>
         <h3 id="Attacking">Attacking</h3>
         <p>
            To attack you roll 2d12 and add 2 modifiers (such as DEX+DEX, STR+STR, or
            PER+PER).
         </p>
         <p>
            A melee INT attack would add INT+INT to the roll for example.
         </p>
         <p>
            To hit the target you must roll equal to or higher than their armour class (AC).
         </p>
         <h4 id="Types of Attack Roll">Types of Attack Roll</h4>
         <ul>
            <li><strong>Weapon, melee, ranged, basic, or auto hit.</strong>
               <ul>
                  <li><strong>Weapon attack</strong> uses your equipped weapon to make the attack
                     roll.
                  <li><strong>Melee weapon attack</strong> uses your equipped melee weapon to make
                     the attack roll.
                  <li><strong>Ranged weapon attack</strong> uses your equipped ranged weapon to
                     make the attack roll - will have DisAdv (-) if you are within melee range of a
                     hostile creature.
                  <li><strong>Melee attack</strong> uses melee range to make the attack roll but
                     does not require a melee weapon. This could include a magical punch attack,
                     which does not require a free hand.
                  <li><strong>Ranged attack</strong> uses the described range to make the attack
                     roll but does not require a ranged weapon - will have DisAdv (-) if you are
                     within melee range of a hostile creature. This could include a magical ranged
                     attack, which does not require a free hand.
                  <li><strong>Versatile attack</strong> uses the described range to make the
                     attack roll - has no disadvantages due to hostile creatures within melee range.
                     This could include a magical ability, which does not require a free hand.
                  <li><strong>Auto hit attack</strong> does not require an attack roll and always
                     hits. Auto hit also ignores a shield - the shield cannot reduce damage from this
                     attack.
                  </li>
               </ul>
            <li><strong>STR, DEX, PER, INT, or SPI.</strong>
               <ul>

                     described as MOD if there are multiple attribute modifiers that could be used.
                  </li>
               </ul>
            <li>For example:

            </li>
         </ul>
         <h4 id="Attacks of Opportunity">Attacks of Opportunity</h4>
         <p>
            A creature with a melee attack available may choose to spend its reaction to
            make a melee attack against a creature that moves out of melee range. The
            available melee attack can only be from an equipped weapon or core ability (such
            as Elemental Blast).
         </p>
         <p>
            Movement used as part of an ability (such as Charge, Hit and Run, or Advance!),
            involuntary movement (such as being pushed or pulled), or teleportation movement
            does not trigger attacks of opportunity.
         </p>
         <h4 id="Critical Hit">Critical Hit</h4>
         <p>
            A critical success is when the 2 dice used for the roll result each have a value
            of 10 or more (double digits).
         </p>
         <p>
            A critical failure is when the 2 dice used for the roll result each have a value
            of 3 or less.
         </p>
         <p>
            If you roll a critical success on an attack roll, it is called a critical hit
            and you deal double base damage damage (Light, Medium, or Heavy), but only add
            modifier once. Bonus damage from abilities is also not doubled on a critical
            hit.
         </p>
         <p>
            Critical hits can be applied as a result of surprise or at the
            GM’s discretion - such as if there is some significant advantage on the attack
            (or special circumstances) that the GM would like to reward.
         </p>
         <h4 id="Multi-Target Attacks">Multi-Target Attacks</h4>
         <p>
            When using a multi-target ability (for example scatter shot or whirlwind) roll
            one attack roll as normal and compare the outcome to all targets’ AC. If you
            have Adv or DisAdv against one or more of the targets, roll separately for those
            targets and then compare to AC and apply damage as normal.
         </p>
         <h4 id="Holding Attacks">Holding Attacks</h4>
         <p>
            Sometimes you want to wait for exactly the right moment to attack, for example a
            dragon swooping down into range. You have the option to spend the 2AP to choose
            a weapon attack or core ability attack (not an expendable ability) and describe
            who you want it to target and when you want it to trigger. For example, “when
            the rat pops its head out of the hole” or “when the eagle gets within grabbing
            distance”, not “when I next see an enemy”. If this happens before the start of
            your next turn, you can choose to spend your reaction to make the attack. If you
            choose not to, or your trigger conditions are not met before the start of your
            next turn you lose the held attack.
         </p>
         <h4 id="Surprise">Surprise</h4>
         <p>
            If you are <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>hidden</a> from a creature 
            and make an attack against it, you will
            have Adv (++) on the attack roll and the attack may also be a
            critical hit due to surprise. An attack can be considered as a surprise 
            when a creature that is not expecting a violent threat of any kind, such as 
            not being involved in combat of any kind and unaware of your presence. 
            After this, the attacked creature and other
            creatures in the area will become aware of your presence - such
            as the target shouting to their allies to warn them about you - and you will 
            no longer be <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>hidden</a>.
         </p>
         <p>
            Also if the target is aware of you but is strongly not expecting you to attack
            them, this may also class as a surprise in some circumstances, gaining Adv (++) 
            and becoming a critical hit. For example, betraying an ally stood beside you to initiate combat.
         </p>
         <h4 id="Concealment">Cover & Concealment</h4>
         <p>
            A ranged attack against a creature you can see and make a valid attack against but has over 3/4 of it's body covered
            by terrain or an obstacle is known as <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>in cover</a>.  All attacks against this enemy is made with DisAdv (-).
            Marking a target removes it's cover bonus.
         </p>
         <p>
            To be considered <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>hidden</a> from another certain creature, the creature must not be able to see you and therefore be 
            unaware of your presence or current location. This might come from making a successful Hide core ability, or from being <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>invisible</a>. 
            An attack against a creature that you are <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>hidden</a> from has Adv (++). This grade of Adv may vary based on GM's discretion. 
            Being <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>hidden</a> can be broken in many ways such as by making noise, being seen, or dealing damage.
         </p>
         <p>
            A melee attack against a target you cannot see (such as when you are <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>blind</a> 
            or the target is <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>invisible</a>) is made with DisAdv (--).

         <h3 id="Range">Range</h3>
         <p>
            There are 3 classes of range:

         <ul>
            <li><strong>Melee refers to a range of 5ft.</strong>
            <li><strong>Short range refers to a range of 25ft.</strong>
               <ul>
                  <li>Attempting an attack above this range gives disadvantage: (-) for every
                     additional 25ft (up to a max of an additional 75ft). E.g. (-) up to 50ft and
                     (---) up to 100ft. <br>This range extension can ONLY be done with
                     abilities if it is specified to have “Short” range.
                  </li>
               </ul>
            <li><strong>Long range refers to a range of 100ft.</strong>
               <ul>
                  <li>Attempting an attack above this range gives disadvantage: (-) for every
                     additional 50ft (up to a max of an additional 150ft). E.g. (-) up to 150ft and
                     (--) up to 200ft.<br>This range extension can ONLY be done with abilities
                     if it is specified to have “Long” range.

         <p>
            Creatures can be <strong>resistant</strong> to damage, this means when they take
            damage it is divided by 2 rounded down. Damage can never be rounded down below
            1. If a creature is hit for 3 fire damage and it is resistant to fire damage it
            will suffer 1 fire damage.
         </p>
         <p>
            If a creature is <strong>weak</strong> to a damage type then they suffer the
            total damage plus 50% (half the damage, round down, and add it to the total
            damage).
         </p>
         <p>
            If a creature is <strong>vulnerable</strong> to a damage type then they suffer
            double the total damage.
         </p>
         <p>
            If a creature is <strong>immune</strong> to a damage type then they suffer no
            damage at all.
         </p>
         <p>
            If a creature is immune to a damage type this cannot be altered, regardless of
            abilities that might try to make them <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>weak</a> 
            or <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>vulnerable</a> to a damage type. There
            may still be some abilities that can temporarily overcome this damage immunity -
            such as Poisoned Strike.

            resistance to a damage type will move you one step to the right on the scale,
            and becoming <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>weak</a> to a damage type will move you one step left on the scale.
            Becoming <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>vulnerable</a> to a damage type will move you two steps to the left on the
            scale. You cannot be moved off this scale. Sources of damage resistance and
            vulnerability must be unique - they cannot both come from the same ability or
            source type (such as a potion), as they will not stack.

         <h4 id="Falling Damage">Falling Damage</h4>
         <p>
            No damage up to 10ft. 5 damage if the creature falls 15ft or more. Increases by
            additional 5 damage for every 5ft above 15ft. You can easily calculate damage
            taken from falling damage by subtracting 10 from the number of ft fallen - that
            is the damage suffered. For example 30ft would be 20 damage, 45ft would be 35
            damage etc.
         </p>
         <p>
            When a creature suffers falling damage, it is also knocked <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>prone</a> -

         </p>
         <p>
            No creature can have 2 instances of the same condition on them - if a creature
            is for example currently <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>stunned</a> and then <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>stunned</a> again, the
            condition is re-applied with the new duration. This re-application is classed as

            When mounted on a willing creature which is larger than you, you can control it
            by spending AP as normal using the creature’s movement speed. Attacks made while
            mounted are made with DisAdv (-). You cannot use movement abilities with the
            creature, however you can dismount as part of the ability use and leave your
            mount behind. More challenging manoeuvres might require a skill check (GM’s
            discretion) - having a relevant skill or trait might remove this requirement.

                     <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>marked</a> and its AC is set to 8. Deal additional damage equal to half the 
                     AC reduction the creature suffers. For example, a reduction from 15 AC to 8 is a 
                     reduction of 7 and thereforeresults in 3 additional damage.

                  You gain the ability to shapeshift into your unlocked animals for 1AP (See Beast
                  Shape table in the Appendix).  When in the animal form, you can use all the animal abilites.
                  Core abilities have unlimited uses as normal, and all the level 1 abilities are automatically 
                  unlocked and are limited to 3 uses every long rest as normal.  By default, the Tiny Animal
                  Beast Shape is unlocked, and you can unlock others with further levels in the Nature class.
                  You can use Nature abilities while in Beast Shape, but abilities from other classes are 
                  unavailable.

                  When you shapeshift into the beast, your physical attributes and AC change, but your Spirit
                  and Intelligence remains the same. You can carry across HP up to that of the max HP of the beast,
                  specified in the Beast table. When you are reduced to 0HP as the beast, you instantly revert back to 
                  your original form minus any HP that you had transferred to the beast - any additional damage is also carried
                  over.  In the Beast Shape, you still have and can use your standard pool of resistance points as normal,
                  No further resistance points are gained or lost from the changing attributes in Beast Shape.
               </p><p>
                  You can voluntarily leave the Beast Shape at any time on your turn for 0AP, and
                  any remaining HP gets returned to your normal health pool.

         <p>
            Strike low and take their feet out from under them. Make a melee weapon
            attack against a creature. On a hit, the creature is knocked <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>prone</a> and
            then <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>hobbled</a> for one turn. 2 FORT points to resist the <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>prone</a>,
            1 FORT point to resist the <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>hobble</a>.
         </p>
         <p>
            Conjure a short range blast to escape your enemies. Make an INT based melee
            attack against a creature. This attack deals Heavy+INT force damage and you are
            moved up to 20ft directly away from the target. No attacks of opportunity are
            provoked.
         </p>
         <p>
            Create illusory bindings that lock a foe in place. Select a creature within
            100ft and <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>immobilise</a> them. 2 WILL points to resist the
            <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>immobilise</a>, if they resist they are <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>hobbled</a>. 1 WILL point to
            resist the <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>hobble</a>, if they resist they suffer Light psychic damage.

         <h3 id="Ability Balance Guidelines">Ability Balance Guidelines</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>In most cases 1AP abilities should not be a consistent source of additional
               damage, where 2AP and 3AP abilities can/should.
            <li>AoE conditions should cost 1 resistance point to resist the effect where
               single target conditions should cost 2.
            <li>Abilities that deal bonus damage should be conditional on some other
               effect/situation. They should not be a consistent source of additional damage.
            <li>There should be no abilities that everyone would want. But if they are very
               tempting to all players (which is still likely) they should appear late in
               specific classes so the player must invest to gain benefit.
            <li>As a rough guide, each class should have a range that almost all abilities
               adhere to. For example Arcane abilities have 100ft range where Elemental
               abilities have 50ft range. This will still vary for some specific abilities.

         <h4 id="Optional Tactician Mode">Optional Tactician Mode</h4>
         <p>
            WARNING NOT TESTED - You (the GM) may choose to have all creatures have 5AP per
            turn. This is currently untested and not necessarily balanced. Some boss
            creatures may already use this system. It works for bosses and not necessarily
            for players due to the wealth of abilities that the players have available -
            there may be exploitable combinations that were not considered when making the
            whole game a 3 AP system.
         </p>
         <h3 id="Design Choice Explanations">Design Choice Explanations</h3>
         <h4 id="The Dice">The Dice</h4>
         <p>
            Why a 2d12 system? Using 2d12 and summing the dice gives a centre weighted
            distribution of results (similar to a normal/Gaussian distribution), as opposed
            to a d20 or d100 system that has uniform distribution. This probability
            distribution makes roll results more consistent, much more like you’d expect in
            real life, meaning you can put greater trust in the result of your skill checks
            and attack rolls.
         </p>
         <p>
            Why 2d12 instead of 2d10 or 1d20 or 2d20 or 4d6 or 2d6? The d12 is a more
            pleasant die to use than the d10, a single d20 gives us a uniform distribution
            (which we want to avoid) and prevents the use of our advantage system, 2d20
            begins to make the maths a little more complex, 4d6 is more dice and more maths
            with little benefit, 2d6 has too little range meaning we couldn’t add 2
            modifiers - or if we did they would have to be very small and this would also
            reduce potential character progression.
         </p>
         <p>
            Why add two modifiers to all rolls? This gives a more fluid system for
            determining what attributes a task requires to complete. A common example in D&D
            is climbing a wall. On one hand you could argue that Strength is the required
            attribute, to pull yourself up. Or you could argue that Dexterity is required to
            gracefully use the cracks and holds to find your way up. With this system it can
            require both. This gives a much more realistic representation of the attributes
            required for a real life task.
         </p>
         <p>
            Why have stacking Adv and DisAdv in this way? Because look how pretty it is.
            This way we can have multiple different conditions and circumstances all
            affecting the same action and it actually leads to something meaningful in the
            game. We also use it to define how proficient you are in a given skill.
