<h1>Arcus RPG</h1>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
Arcus is a pen and paper tabletop role playing game (TTRPG). This system draws
inspiration from a wide variety of tabletop, video game, and board game systems
to deliver a balanced and simple, yet deep and tactical experience compared to
other traditional tabletop RPGs. Arcus’ unique take on combat and character
abilities make fights incredibly varied, team based, with great tactical depth
and a high skill ceiling.
</p>
<p>
If you like Divinity Original Sin 2, Baldur’s Gate 3, Gloomhaven, or Dungeons
and Dragons 5e but wish the combat was more engaging - this might just be the
TTRPG for you.
</p>
<p>
Note: This is an unfinished ruleset and is still under development. Changes may
occur regularly. All <strong>yellow</strong> text is work that is under
consideration for tweaks or changes - use with caution. All <strong>red
</strong>text (not to be confused with <strong>this red</strong> text) is
unfinished work or ideas that need to be removed or completely reworked - should
not be used.
</p>
<h1>How to Play</h1>
<p>
Play runs very similarly to other TTRPG systems, the game master (GM) creates
and describes the world, and the player characters (PCs) then say what they want
their character to do. If the action the PCs wish to take involves some degree
of difficulty, for example jumping a large gap or avoiding a rock fall, they
must roll dice to determine if the actions result in success or failure. The GM
then narrates what happens as a result of the PCs’ actions. Battles, adventures
and entire stories can be told using this simple back and forth system.

<strong>DC Values:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    5 - Very Easy
</p>
<p>
    10 - Easy
</p>
<p>
    15 - Moderate
</p>
<p>
    18 - Hard
</p>
<p>
    20 - Very Hard
</p>
<p>
    25 - Formidable
</p>
<p>
    30 - Virtually Impossible
</p>
<p>
    35 - Godly
</p>
<p>
The difference between success and failure is not always clear cut. The degree
of success and failure can depend on the difference between the roll result and
the DC. This degree of success is determined entirely by the GM but should be
consistent.
</p>
<h2>Dice System</h2>
<p>
This game uses a 2d12 system - roll and add the 2d12 values together for a total
that must be equal to or greater than a given difficulty value (chosen by the
GM) to be successful.
</p>
<p>
Every 2d12 roll will add 2 modifiers to it. These modifiers will come from a
creature’s attributes such as strength, dexterity, and intelligence - the same
attribute can be used twice in the same roll. The attributes used for the roll
will depend on the GM’s request based on the action being taken.
</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>
Let’s take a warrior with +3 strength modifier, +1 dexterity modifier, and +0
perception modifier. If they want to take an action such as kicking down a door,
the GM would ask them to make a “strength plus strength check”. This means the
warrior will roll 2d12 as always and add their strength modifier twice to the
roll (+6 total modifier bonus). If the warrior wants to pick a lock, the GM
might ask them to make a “dexterity plus perception check” so the warrior will
roll 2d12 and add their dexterity and perception modifiers to the roll (+1 total
modifier bonus).
</p>
<h3>Advantage and Disadvantage</h3>
<p>
Advantage (Adv) and disadvantage (DisAdv) range from -3 (---) to +3 (+++) and
can be applied to a roll/check being made. The table below describes what effect
Adv and DisAdv have on a roll.
</p>
<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Advantage/Disadvantage</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Result</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>---
   </td>
   <td>Roll 5 dice and add the lowest 2 dice values.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>--
   </td>
   <td>Roll 4 dice and add the lowest 2 dice values.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>-
   </td>
   <td>Roll 3 dice and add the lowest 2 dice values.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>0
   </td>
   <td>Roll 2 dice and add all dice values.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>+
   </td>
   <td>Roll 3 dice and add the highest 2 dice values.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>++
   </td>
   <td>Roll 4 dice and add the highest 2 dice values.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>+++
   </td>
   <td>Roll 5 dice and add the highest 2 dice values.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
Sources of Adv and DisAdv vary greatly, such as attacking from high ground, or a
benefit granted by an ability. You will only ever use 2 dice values to get the
total for a roll.
</p>
<p>
Adv/DisAdv is often displayed as a series of (+) or (-) signs in brackets and
these cancel each other out. As an example, an ability grants a warrior Adv (++)
on their next attack. Other circumstances, such as a cloud of smoke, mean that
the attack also has DisAdv (-). This results in (++-) for the attack roll. The
(-) then cancels one (+) to give the final result of (+) for the attack roll.
</p>
<h3>Critical Successes & Critical Failures</h3>
<p>
A critical success is when the 2 dice used for the roll result each have a value
of 10 or more (double digits).
</p>
<p>
A critical failure is when the 2 dice used for the roll result each have a value
of 3 or less.
</p>
<p>
Critical successes generally mean a success with some additional bonus - such as
additional damage or beneficial results. Critical failures generally mean you
fail the check regardless of the modifiers added and the DC. However, it is up
to the GM to decide how they wish to handle it in their game - it should be
consistent.
</p>
<h3>Inspiration</h3>
<p>
Throughout the game, players can earn inspiration points. This is gained either
by certain traits (General: Inspiring), magic items, or most commonly as a
reward by the DM for when a player does something really cool. A player role
plays a speech well before a battle? Inspiration! A player thinks of a really
clever way to get round a trap, but still comes down to a check? Inspiration!
<br><br>The GM can give this inspiration directly to the action,
or to the players to use when they see fit. This can then be used in a skill
check or attack roll to give them Adv (+) where appropriate. Adv (+) is only a
small buff to the roll but can still feel like a great way to be rewarded and
can be given out to players quite liberally.
</p>

</p>
<h1>Creating a Character - Step by Step</h1>
<h2>Step 1 - Who Do You Want To Be?</h2>
<p>
There are many ways to start making your character in Arcus and the rules should
accommodate whatever fantasy character you wish to create (within reason). In
particular, the race/creature you decide to be makes no difference to the
capabilities of your character so there are no restrictions. You should still
discuss with your GM what races there are and how being this race might affect
your character’s life. Your race also shouldn’t give you any significant bonuses
such as extra arms or the ability to fly, but you can discuss how to make it
fair and realistic with your GM.
</p>
<p>
Below are some suggestions on where to start, we recommend starting with 1. and
going through our step by step guide, but you can read through each and find
your preference.
</p>
<ol>
<li>You could start by imagining up the flavour of character first - such as a
cunning lizardman rogue with an obsession for doodling, or a proud steam powered
golem paladin on a mission to find their creator, or a fun loving human mage
with an affinity for protecting their friends and destroying things with fire.
You’re looking for a main characteristic, a race, a class, and a goal. With this
you can go through character creation starting with Attributes (step 2), working
out which attributes, skills, traits, classes, and abilities best suit what you
are trying to make.
<li>You could instead start with the mechanics - what sort of playstyle you want
to achieve, and what abilities you want your character to have. Do you want them
to be a support role with healing and party boosting effects? Maybe look into
Arcane or Mortality classes. Would you rather play as a brutish tank with crowd
control and melee capabilities? Look into Warrior or even Elemental if you want
to add a flair of magic. Go to the Classes section (step 5) first for summaries
of each class and what they can help you create.
<li>You could start with your character’s personality and backstory. Perhaps you
want to write a story about how your character, a humble miller, daughter of a
miller, becomes a warrior on a path for vengeance after her village is
plundered. How this influenced her to be cynical about the world and distrusting
of others - she’s had to become independent but now needs help and is struggling
with the idea of attachment. Go to the Personality and History section (step 8)
to get started with this stage of character creation.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Step 2 - Attributes</h2>
<p>
Attributes outline your character’s core physical and mental capabilities. Is
your character strong or weak? Fast or slow? Smart or simple? Confident or shy?
These questions will help you work out your character’s attributes.
</p>
<p>
There are 6 main attributes that all creatures and characters will have:
</p>
<p>
<strong>Strength (STR)</strong> - a character's physical strength and brute
force. Primarily affects attacks with some melee weapons and ability to use a
shield.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Constitution (CON)</strong> - a combination of the character's overall
health and endurance. Primarily affects your HP total.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Dexterity (DEX)</strong> - a character's hand-eye coordination, balance,
and overall grace. Primarily affects your armour class, attacks with some melee
weapons, and thrown ranged attacks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Perception (PER)</strong> - a character's senses/awareness, ability to
aim, and their instinctive ability to pick up on details. Primarily affects
initiative and ranged weapon attacks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Intelligence (INT)</strong> - a character's logic and reasoning
capabilities as well as memory and knowledge. Primarily affects some
spellcasting abilities and your number of skills.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Spirit (SPI)</strong> - a character's mental resolve, confidence and
creativity. Primarily affects some spellcasting abilities and your total
resistance points.
</p>
<p>
Attribute values commonly range from 10 to 20, where 10 roughly describes the
average human capability, but can range from 1 to 30 in some creatures. The
value of the attribute will generate a modifier that can be added to dice rolls.
</p>
<p>
At level 1 you have a value 10 in each attribute and 16 points to put into them
as you wish. At level 1 the max value you can have in an attribute is 15, and
past level 1 the max is 20. For example, at level 1 you could make a character
with 16 Strength, 14 Constitution, 16 Dexterity, 10 Perception, 10 Intelligence,
and 10 Spirit.
</p>
<p>
Below is a table of the attribute values and the modifier you will have based on
the value.
</p>

<p>
Every even level (2, 4, 6, 8, 10…) you gain 1 additional attribute point to
spend. Increasing an attribute value by 1 always costs 1 attribute point.

<p>
In some rare cases your GM may allow you to drop an attribute score below 10,
but this should be for roleplaying purposes only - as 10 is already below
average. You also cannot reduce your attributes in a way that would lead to you
having negative resistance points (see next section).
</p>
<h2>Step 3 - Resistance Points</h2>
<p>
Resistance points are a resource that you will spend to prevent incoming
negative effects, and negate damage. You regain them all after a long rest.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Fortitude (FORT)</strong> - the ability to resist negative effects using
your strength and constitution - such as a sturdy stance to avoid being knocked
over by a sweeping attack, or a poisonous gas having no effect on you.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Reflex (REFL)</strong> - the ability to resist negative effects using
your dexterity and perception - such as dodging an explosion of fire or a hail
of arrows.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Will (WILL)</strong> - the ability to resist negative effects using your
intelligence and spirit - such as focusing your mind to avoid being manipulated
by a spell, or having the confidence to not become frightened.
</p>
<h3>How Many Resistance Points Do I Have?</h3>
<p>
Next calculate your resistance points from your attributes. To calculate how
many you have, subtract 10 from each related attribute value, then add the two
numbers together.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Fortitude (FORT) </strong>-<strong> </strong>your strength value -10
added to your constitution value -10.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Reflex (REFL)</strong> - your dexterity value -10 added to your
perception value -10.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Will (WILL)</strong> - your intelligence value -10 added to your spirit
value -10.
</p>
<p>
For example, a character with 16 STR and 12 CON has 6 points in STR and 2 in
CON, so has (6+2) 8 FORT resistance points.
</p>
<p>
You also gain additional resistance points to assign as you wish equal to your
SPI modifier. A creature with +2 SPI modifier will have 2 additional resistance
points to assign as they wish, such as 1 extra FORT point and 1 extra WILL
point. When your SPI modifier increases you may assign the additional resistance
points freely.
</p>
<h3>How Do I Use Resistance Points?</h3>
<p>
There are 2 ways to spend resistance points:
</p>
<h4>Resisting Incoming Effects</h4>
<p>
The GM will tell you the recommended cost of resisting an incoming effect. To
resist it you will choose how many resistance points to spend and then roll
1d12. If you spend the recommended resistance points, reduce your current
resistance points by the cost. If you spend one less than recommended you
successfully resist on a 8 or higher, if you spend equal to the recommended you
successfully resist on a 3 or higher, if you spend one more than recommended you
automatically succeed. If you spend two less than the recommended resistance
points or fail the roll you are inflicted with the condition.
</p>
<h4>Resisting Incoming Damage</h4>
<p>
You can negate a single instance of incoming damage by spending any 5 of your
remaining resistance points. You can do this at any time and it does not cost a
reaction.
</p>
<p>
However, the GM may ask you to describe how you negate the damage. This gives
the player an opportunity to describe the cool and heroic actions of their
character to avoid the damage/effect. It also gives the GM the opportunity, in
some very rare cases, to deny the damage reduction if it cannot make sense for
the damage to the character to be negated, or come to a reasonable middleground.
Such as if the player is paralysed and suffers damage the player cannot negate
the damage, but if it would kill them the GM can let the player drop to 1 HP and
fall unconscious instead. Or in even rarer cases such as being crushed by a wave
of magma the player might have no chance of survival and die instantly. Note to
GMs, don’t crush your players with waves of magma - that’s mean.
</p>
<h3>Notes For The GM</h3>
<p>
The player can choose not to spend your resistance points and save them for
later effects or damage reduction. The GM's monsters and NPCs should generally
spend resistance points if they can - assuming the condition would actually
affect them (e.g. a wolf would not resist something that prevents it from using
magical abilities). This is to help the tactical part of knowing when the
enemies will run out of resistance points, and to avoid metagaming. Some
particularly intelligent creatures that may have some knowledge of the party’s
abilities could save and use them even more wisely - again the GM should avoid
metagaming.
</p>
<p>
Resistance points of enemies and creatures should preferably be visible to the
players. This makes sure that the players will know if or not their ability will
definitely have an effect before they use it. It adds a layer of consistency to
combat and prevents players from being disappointed when their ability is
unexpectedly resisted. You can perhaps do this in more vague terms rather than
giving specific values depending on how you want to play. For example “the
monster looks very tough and well fortified, but slow and unintelligent”, would
mean the monster has high FORT but low REFL and WILL.
</p>
<p>
In general creatures will have far fewer resistance points than the players, but
bosses may have more. For example, most basic creatures will have 0 resistance
points in at least 1 or 2 areas. These weaknesses should make sense based on the
type and flavour of the creature. A light and nimble bandit may have 2 REFL
points and 0 WILL or FORT. While a spellcaster may have 2 WILL and 0 FORT or
REFL.
</p>
<p>
GM tip: You can have the creatures you control not need to roll for resistance
checks. Instead, if the creature has the necessary resistance points it spends
them and automatically resists the effect. And if it does not have the required
resistance points it automatically fails the check. Rolling for resistances
mainly adds to the tension the players feel and can be ignored for monsters to
speed up combat. You can always add this feature back in for more significant
fights or when you’re more used to running the game.
</p>
<p>
Enemies should not be able to spend resistance points to negate damage.
</p>
<h2>Step 4 - Hit Points</h2>
<p>
Your Hit Points (HP) or Health at level 1 is equal to your CON Attribute value
multiplied by 2. So a CON of 16 results in 32 HP at level 1.
</p>
<p>
Every odd level after first (3, 5, 7, 9 etc.) you gain 10 plus your CON modifier
in additional HP. So with the same CON value you’d have 32 at level 2, 45 at
level 3, 58 at level 5, and so on.
</p>
<h3>Temporary Hit Points</h3>
<p>
Temporary hit points (Temp HP) last until the start of the turn of the creature
that granted the Temp HP - unless stated otherwise. They act as normal HP but
are always used before regular HP. You may have multiple sources of Temp HP and
these should be kept separate -. the creature with the Temp HP can choose which
pool is used first.
</p>
<h2>Step 5 - Classes</h2>
<p>
Every level a character has allows 1 point/level to be assigned to a class of
their choice. Classes are either physical or magical and placing points in them
allows a character to unlock abilities relating to that class. Putting levels
into multiple classes is actively encouraged, and there is no restriction or
downside to which you choose and the order in which you progress in them.
</p>

<h3>Abilities</h3>
<p>
The first level assigned a class automatically gives the character all of the
core abilities in that class (denoted by “Core” in the level column). They then
choose 2 abilities to unlock and use, and every level after that unlocks 1
additional ability. If you put a level in a class you must choose the abilities
you unlock from that chosen class. You can choose new abilities from anywhere in
the class equal or less than your level in that class. You cannot unlock an
ability you already possess (that has the same name).
</p>
<p>
You can put more than 10 levels in a given class to unlock more abilities.
</p>
<p>
All abilities with an AP cost have 3 uses per long rest, unless there is a “-”
in the level column in which case it has unlimited uses. Passive and reaction
abilities are always taking effect or have unlimited uses (unless they also have
an AP cost which takes priority and is limited to 3 uses).
</p>
<p>
Some abilities will have restrictions as to whether they can be done with ranged
or melee weapons. This will be made clear in the description/target columns.
Other abilities can be used regardless of weapon type (see Types of Attack Roll
section).
</p>
<h3>Spellcasting</h3>
<p>
Abilities and spells that do not mention a weapon (such as most abilities from
magical classes) do not require a weapon of any kind - they can even be
performed without a free hand. Therefore, you can wield weapons and cast spells
at the same time. Each magical class also has 1 or 2 abilities that have
unlimited uses which can be used as a regular attack instead of using a weapon.
</p>
<h2>Step 6 - Skills & Traits</h2>
<p>
Level 1 characters start with 4 skills or traits of their choice (explained
below), each skill at a proficient (+) level and they must meet the requirements
of the chosen traits. Every odd level after this (3, 5, 7 … 19) 1 additional
point is gained to either spend on an additional skill proficiency level, or an
additional trait.
</p>
<p>
Characters also gain additional skills equal to their INT modifier. These can
only be used to become proficient (+), and cannot be spent to become expert (++)
or master (+++).
</p>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<p>
Skills are normally 1 or 2 words that describe something your character can do
particularly well, regardless of the attributes needed for the task. Look at the
Skill Ideas section below and consider the following questions when deciding
what skills your character might have: What has your character grown up doing?
What work have they done? What are they good at? What task might they be faced
with that they can do better than most? You should always discuss with your GM
what might be good skills to have, that aren’t too general or too specific.
</p>
<p>
Each character will have a list of skills, each one ranging in degree of
expertise:
</p>
<p>
Proficient (+)
</p>
<p>
Expert (++)
</p>
<p>
Master (+++)
</p>
<p>
The (+) notation describes the degree of Adv they will get on rolls/checks
involving that skill. For example, the GM asks a warrior to “make a strength
plus strength check to jump the gap”. The warrior is an expert (++) in athletics
so they ask the GM if they can use their athletics for the check, the GM deems
this appropriate and allows it. The warrior then makes the check with Adv (++)
adding their strength modifier twice.
</p>
<p>
The attributes used for the same skill may vary. For example if the same warrior
as detailed above wants to run, jump, and duck past a couple of obstacles, the
GM may ask them to “make a strength plus dexterity check to run and avoid the
obstacles”. The GM will still allow the warrior to use their athletics skill,
giving them Adv (++) on the roll and then adding their strength and dexterity
modifiers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Skill Ideas:</strong>
</p>
<p>
This is just a list of skill ideas, this should not be taken as the definitive
list of skills. Remember to discuss with your GM which skills you would like to
have, and be accepting of adjustments that may need to be made to them so that
they fit well in the world.

<h3>Traits</h3>
<p>
Traits are special abilities that can be found in the trait tables below. They
are often non-combat abilities that add flavour and utility to a character or
creature. Some also have specified requirements that a character must meet to be
able to unlock the trait. Some are passive, while others are limited to 1 or 3
uses.
</p>
<p>
TODO: Traits are unfinished and many of them need tweaking and reworking. You
should discuss with your GM which traits they are comfortable letting you have.
</p>
<p>
TODO: Resisting trait abilities/effects may move away from using the resistance
point system and use a contested roll instead. Or we could implement the
optional empowered resistance drain that would make things work a bit more
smoothly (see appendix).

<h2>Step 7 - Equipment</h2>
<h3>Weapons</h3>
<p>
Below are the details on all the potential weapons you might have. Weapons are
fluid and can be reskinned in many ways - in theory you can think of any fantasy
weapon and the rules should have a way of putting that into the game. Remember
that you can wield weapons and cast spells at the same time (no free hand
required) or go without any weapons and just use spells.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Weapon Properties:</strong> Light, Medium, Heavy, One-handed,
Two-handed, Melee, Versatile, Ranged
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Melee weapons</strong> have a range of 5ft, this means you have to
be adjacent to the enemy to make an attack. Melee attacks will use STR or DEX
depending on the weapon and the wielder’s choice.
<li>All <strong>ranged weapons</strong> have DisAdv (-) on attacks made when
there is a hostile creature within 5ft of you. Ranged only weapons will use PER,
if the weapon is versatile it will use DEX to be thrown.
<li><strong>Versatile weapons</strong> can be either used as melee weapons (STR
or DEX) or as ranged (thrown using DEX).
<li>There are 3 damage classes of attacks. These are <strong>Light, Medium, and
Heavy</strong>. This damage scales with level, and weapons with these
characteristics have varying properties. See Damage section in Combat for damage
values.
<li><strong>Unarmed attacks</strong> are melee only, use STR or DEX to attack
and deal Light damage. However you cannot add your modifier to the damage. They
can be “dual-wielded”.
<li><strong>Light Weapons</strong> are all one-handed. Light weapons are either
melee, versatile or ranged. If they are melee or versatile they will use STR or
DEX for melee attacks (wielder’s choice) and DEX for thrown ranged attacks. If
they are ranged only they will use PER and have long range. All Light versatile
and ranged weapons will have short range (25ft).
<ul>
<li>Examples of <strong>Light melee</strong> <strong>weapons</strong>: fists or
knuckle dusters.
<li>Examples of <strong>Light versatile</strong> <strong>weapons</strong>:
dagger, handaxe, or an improvised weapon such as a brick.
<li>Examples of <strong>Light ranged</strong> <strong>weapons</strong>: hand
crossbow, blowdart, or a small firearm.
</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Medium melee weapons</strong> are one-handed and can use DEX or STR
to attack.
<ul>
<li>Examples of Medium melee weapons: longsword, axe, or a mace.
</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Medium ranged only weapons</strong> are all two handed, require PER
to attack, and have long range (100ft).
<ul>
<li>Examples of Medium ranged weapons: bow, crossbow, or an assault rifle.
</li>
</ul>
<li>Note: Medium weapons cannot be versatile.
<li><strong>Heavy melee weapons</strong> are all two-handed and require STR to
use.
<ul>
<li>Examples of Heavy melee weapons: greatsword, greataxe, or a large club.
</li>
</ul>
<li>Note: Heavy weapons cannot be versatile.
<li><strong>Dual wielding</strong> can be done with 2 Light weapons, or a Medium
and a Light weapon. Both must be one-handed. Attacks that involve both weapons
can make 1 attack roll against a single target - or split into 2 against
multiple targets, such as melee attack with your main hand melee weapon then
throw a dagger at a different target with your offhand. Damage is calculated as
normal for the weapon in the main hand, and the off-hand weapon just adds base
damage (no additional attribute bonus). Attack rolls while dual wielding with a
Medium and Light weapon are calculated with a -2 modifier. Attack rolls while
dual wielding 2 Light weapons are done as normal.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Weapon Example Table</h4>
<p>
A summary of how the different weapons will work in the game - each weapon can
be reskinned or flavoured to fit what you want your character to use. For
example, you might use: knuckle dusters or a simple improvised weapon instead of
a club; a handaxe, sickle or stiletto instead of a dagger; a rapier, scimitar,
axe, mace, spear or short staff instead of a sword; a greataxe, greatclub,
scythe or large spear instead of a greatsword; a crossbow or rifle instead of a
bow; a blowdart or pistol instead of a light crossbow.

<h3>Armour and Armour Class (AC)</h3>

Armour class is equal to 11 plus your DEX modifier. This is the number that
enemies must roll equal to or higher than to hit you successfully. A DEX
modifier of +4 would result in an AC of 15.

<h3>Shields</h3>
<p>
A shield takes 1 hand to equip (your off hand), and grants an ability with
unlimited uses. This ability can be used when you suffer any amount of damage,
but only once per turn (does not use a reaction): It is reduced by your STR
modifier in damage (minimum 0). This damage reduction occurs before any other
damage reduction. Auto-hit attacks ignore shields.

<h2>Step 8 - Personality and History</h2>
<p>
All characters have their strengths and weaknesses, and in role playing both are
equally fun. The following questions will help you determine your character’s
personality - remember that every trait is a sliding scale where your character
could be anywhere in between these extremes. Are they funny or serious?
Optimistic or pessimistic? Sociable or quiet? Honest or deceptive? Kind or
cruel? Passionate or stoic? Collaborative or independent? Open-minded or
stubborn? Energetic or calm? Spiritual or material? Generous or greedy?
Respectful or rude? Forgiving or vengeful? Modest or boasting? Creative or
traditional?
</p>
<p>
You can delve further by asking how your character might behave and react in
different situations, and asking some more applied personality questions. Would
your character offer to help someone for free or expect payment? If threatened,
would your character seek a peaceful outcome or quickly resort to violence?
Could your character forgive someone for stealing from them, or would they
demand vengeance? How would your character react to being insulted? What type of
shop or treasure interests your character? Do you have a role model? What are
your character’s short and long term motives/goals? Are there any political or
social views that your character strongly agrees or disagrees with? Are there
any organisations in the world that your character strongly agrees or disagrees
with? What are your character’s deepest fears? What are your character’s
greatest values? What does your character do for fun?
</p>
<p>
Questions to ask about your character’s history - also see the Skills and Traits
section (step 5). Where is your character from? What is their family like - what
have they done and where are they now? What major events have occurred during
your character’s life so far? What have they done in response and how has it
moulded your character into who they are now? How has that affected their
motives? What secrets do they have? How did your character gain the attributes
and class that they are now? Does your character have few or many friends? Are
any of those friends notable, if so what are they like? What kind of people do
you trust and mistrust? Does your character have any hobbies?

<h1>Out of Combat</h1>
<h2>Passive Perception</h2>
<p>
A creature’s passive perception is equal to 10+PER+PER.
</p>

<p>
You can only gain the benefit of a short rest once per long rest.
</p>
<h3>Short Rests (30 mins)</h3>

</p>
<p>
All active abilities you have fade during this rest.
</p>
<h3>Long Rests (8 hours)</h3>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Regain all resistance points.
</p>
<h1>Combat</h1>
<h2>How To Run Combat</h2>
<ol>
<li>Set up the game board (hex/square grid).
<ol>
<li>Define/draw the terrain and environment of the fight (difficult, impassible,
special).
<li>Decide character/creature locations.
<li>Any other special conditions or descriptions for the players.
</li>
</ol>
<li>Roll initiative for players and enemies.
<ol>
<li>Initiative is calculated by rolling 2d12 and adding PER+PER.
</li>
</ol>
<li>Each creature takes their turn in order, spending up to 3 of their action
points (AP) to move and fight. When each creature has completed a turn, this
completes 1 round of combat.
<ol>
<li>Start with the highest initiative.
<li>Reactions may trigger outside of a character/creature’s turn.
<li>After the creature with lowest initiative finishes their turn a round of
combat is complete, repeat step 3 until the combat is complete (when there is no
longer a conflict to be resolved).
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Initiative</h2>
<p>
Initiative is calculated by rolling 2d12 and adding PER+PER.
</p>
<h2>Action Point System</h2>
<p>
All creatures have 3 action points (AP) to spend every turn. They are set back
to 3 AP at the start of their next turn. However, some conditions and abilities
may affect this.
</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>
You gain a reaction at the start of your turn every round which can be spent on
various abilities and attacks of opportunity. It can be spent at any point,
either on your turn or during another creature’s turn.
</p>
<h2>Movement</h2>
<p>
Your base movement speed is 25ft. However, this can be affected by armour,
abilities, and equipment. You can spend 1 AP to move up to your base movement
speed. This movement can be broken up around the other things you do on your
turn - for example with 25ft of movement you could move 10ft, then attack, then
move the remaining 15ft.
</p>
<h3>Difficult Terrain</h3>
<p>
It takes 10ft of movement instead of 5ft to move into a tile that is considered
difficult terrain. Creatures can also move through allies as if they were
difficult terrain. Creatures cannot move through other hostile creatures.
</p>
<h3>Types of Movement</h3>
<h4>Regular Movement</h4>
<p>
Regular movement includes running, walking, and crawling. Generally referred to
as “move” or “movement”.
</p>
<h4>Jumping Movement</h4>
<p>
Jumping movement works the same as regular movement except obstacles (such as
gaps, low obstacles, or small creatures) can be avoided on the path. What can or
cannot be jumped over is up to the GM’s discretion. The jump may require a roll
depending on the distance or height of the jump - this will use strength and/or
dexterity depending on the nature of the jump (strength for greater distance,
dexterity for greater accuracy). Generally referred to as “jump” or “jumping”.
</p>
<h4>Climbing Movement</h4>
<p>
Climbing movement works the same as regular movement but is done up a more
vertical surface such as up a wall or a tree. What can or cannot be climbed is
up to the GM’s discretion. The GM will make the creature perform a skill check
based on the difficulty of the surface they are attempting to climb. If
successful the creature can climb as if the surface was difficult terrain. The
creature must repeat the skill check every time it wishes to move its base
movement speed - it is up to the GM if and when they may need to repeat the
skill check based on time spent climbing or if the difficulty of the climb
significantly changes.
</p>
<h4>Swimming Movement</h4>
<p>
Swimming movement works the same as regular movement but is done through a
liquid such as water or slime. What can or cannot be swam through is up to the
GM’s discretion. The GM will make the creature perform a skill check based on
the difficulty. If successful the creature can swim as if the liquid was
difficult terrain - it is up to the GM if and when they may need to repeat the
skill check based on time spent swimming or if the difficulty of the swim
significantly changes.
</p>
<h4>Teleportation Movement</h4>
<p>
Teleportation movement allows a creature to move to a point they can see,
ignoring all obstacles between their start and end point. Teleportation movement
ignores all movement restrictions the creature might have (<em>immobilised
</em>or <em>hobbled </em>specifically). Teleportation movement happens
instantaneously and cannot be broken up throughout a turn. A creature can
teleport to a point in mid-air. Generally referred to as “teleport”,
“teleportation” or “teleported”.
</p>
<h4>Flying Movement</h4>
<p>
Flying movement allows movement in all directions including directly and
diagonally up and down. A creature can only fly if they have a flying movement
speed. Some abilities or transformations can unlock a flying movement speed.
</p>
<p>
A flying creature does not have to end its movement on the ground - it does not
fall or take falling damage while flying. If the creature is knocked <em>prone
</em>or <em>stunned </em>they are no longer flying and will immediately fall at
normal speed and take fall damage as normal - the creature becomes flying again
when it spends flying movement speed. Generally referred to as “fly”, “flight”
or “flying”.
</p>
<h4>Voluntary Movement</h4>
<p>
Movement is considered voluntary if the creature has a choice of how it moves
and where. Most movement is considered voluntary. For example, base movement, or
movement gained from a creature’s own abilities or ally’s abilities.
</p>
<h4>Involuntary Movement</h4>
<p>
Movement is considered involuntary if the creature does not have a choice of how
it moves and where. For example, a hostile pulling, pushing, or teleporting
another creature, or any movement effect on a creature that it can attempt to
resist. Movement due to being <em>taunted</em>, <em>frightened</em>,<em> </em>or
<em>dominated </em>is still considered voluntary movement.
</p>
<h4>Push/Pull Movement</h4>
<p>
Push/pull movement is always involuntary and ignores difficult terrain and
movement restrictions the creature might have (<em>immobilised</em>,
<em>paralysed</em>,<em> </em>or <em>hobbled </em>specifically) unless the GM
deems it unreasonable. Generally referred to as “push”, “pushed”, “pull”, or
“pulled”.
</p>
<h2>Attacking</h2>
<p>
To attack you roll 2d12 and add 2 modifiers (such as DEX+DEX, STR+STR, or
PER+PER).
</p>
<p>
A melee INT attack would add INT+INT to the roll for example.
</p>
<p>
To hit the target you must roll equal to or higher than their armour class (AC).
</p>
<h3>Types of Attack Roll</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Weapon, melee, ranged, basic, or auto hit.</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Weapon attack</strong> uses your equipped weapon to make the attack
roll.
<li><strong>Melee weapon attack</strong> uses your equipped melee weapon to make
the attack roll.
<li><strong>Ranged weapon attack</strong> uses your equipped ranged weapon to
make the attack roll - will have DisAdv (-) if you are within melee range of a
hostile creature.
<li><strong>Melee attack</strong> uses melee range to make the attack roll but
does not require a melee weapon. This could include a magical punch attack,
which does not require a free hand.
<li><strong>Ranged attack</strong> uses the described range to make the attack
roll but does not require a ranged weapon - will have DisAdv (-) if you are
within melee range of a hostile creature. This could include a magical ranged
attack, which does not require a free hand.
<li><strong>Versatile attack</strong> uses the described range to make the
attack roll - has no disadvantages due to hostile creatures within melee range.
This could include a magical ability, which does not require a free hand.
<li><strong>Auto hit attack</strong> does not require an attack roll and always
hits. Auto hit also ignores a shield - the shield cannot reduce damage from this
attack.
</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>STR, DEX, PER, INT, or SPI.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Describes the attribute modifier used to make the attack roll. Can also be
described as MOD if there are multiple attribute modifiers that could be used.
</li>
</ul>
<li>For example:
<ul>
<li>“Make a ranged INT attack…”
<li>“Make a melee weapon attack…”
<li>“Make an auto hit weapon attack…”
<li>“Make an auto hit attack…”
<li>“Make a versatile INT attack…”
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Attacks of Opportunity</h3>
<p>
A creature with a melee attack available may choose to spend its reaction to
make a melee attack against a creature that moves out of melee range. The
available melee attack can only be from an equipped weapon or core ability (such
as Elemental Blast).
</p>
<p>
Movement used as part of an ability (such as Charge, Hit and Run, or Advance!),
involuntary movement (such as being pushed or pulled), or teleportation movement
does not trigger attacks of opportunity.
</p>
<h3>Critical Hit</h3>
<p>
A critical success is when the 2 dice used for the roll result each have a value
of 10 or more (double digits).
</p>
<p>
A critical failure is when the 2 dice used for the roll result each have a value
of 3 or less.
</p>
<p>
If you roll a critical success on an attack roll, it is called a critical hit
and you deal double base damage damage (Light, Medium, or Heavy), but only add
modifier once. Bonus damage from abilities is also not doubled on a critical
hit.
</p>
<p>
Critical hits can be applied as a result of surprise or concealment or at the
GM’s discretion - such as if there is some significant advantage on the attack
(or special circumstances) that the GM would like to reward.
</p>
<h3>Multi-Target Attacks</h3>
<p>
When using a multi-target ability (for example scatter shot or whirlwind) roll
one attack roll as normal and compare the outcome to all targets’ AC. If you
have Adv or DisAdv against one or more of the targets, roll separately for those
targets and then compare to AC and apply damage as normal.
</p>
<h3>Holding Attacks</h3>
<p>
Sometimes you want to wait for exactly the right moment to attack, for example a
dragon swooping down into range. You have the option to spend the 2AP to choose
a weapon attack or core ability attack (not an expendable ability) and describe
who you want it to target and when you want it to trigger. For example, “when
the rat pops its head out of the hole” or “when the eagle gets within grabbing
distance”, not “when I next see an enemy”. If this happens before the start of
your next turn, you can choose to spend your reaction to make the attack. If you
choose not to, or your trigger conditions are not met before the start of your
next turn you lose the held attack.
</p>
<h3>Surprise</h3>
<p>
If you attack a target from stealth that is unaware that you exist, you will
have Adv (++) on the attack from being hidden and the attack may also be a
critical hit due to surprise (GM’s discretion). After this, the target and other
targets in the area (GM’s discretion) will become aware of your presence - such
as the target shouting to their allies to warn them about you.
</p>
<p>
Also if the target is aware of you but is strongly not expecting you to attack
them, this may also class as a surprise and gain Adv (++) and even be a critical
hit (GM’s discretion).
</p>
<h3>Concealment</h3>
<p>
A melee attack against a target you cannot see (such as when you are <em>blind
</em>or the target is <em>invisible</em>) is made with DisAdv (--).
</p>
<p>
A ranged attack against a target you cannot see (such as when you are <em>blind
</em>or the target is <em>invisible</em>) is made with DisAdv (---).
</p>
<p>
An attack against a target that is unaware of your existence (such as when you
are hidden/<em>invisible</em> and combat hasn’t started) has Adv (++).
</p>
<h2>Range</h2>
<p>
There are 3 classes of range:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Melee refers to a range of 5ft.</strong>
<li><strong>Short range refers to a range of 25ft.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Attempting an attack above this range gives disadvantage: (-) for every
additional 25ft (up to a max of an additional 75ft). E.g. (-) up to 50ft and
(---) up to 100ft. <br>This range extension can ONLY be done with
abilities if it is specified to have “Short” range.
</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Long range refers to a range of 100ft.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Attempting an attack above this range gives disadvantage: (-) for every
additional 50ft (up to a max of an additional 150ft). E.g. (-) up to 150ft and
(--) up to 200ft.<br>This range extension can ONLY be done with abilities
if it is specified to have “Long” range.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
These values will be referred to throughout. If an ability has a specific range
it can only be used within that range.
</p>
<h2>Damage</h2>
<p>
Base weapon damage scales with level, leading you to take on stronger foes the
higher level you are.

<p>
To this value you add the appropriate damage modifier. If you used DEX+DEX for
the attack, you add DEX (once) to the damage.
</p>
<p>
If a level 1 character had +3 to INT and was making an INT based attack that
dealt Light physical damage: They would first make an attack with INT+INT bonus
(2d12+3+3). If successful they would then deal Light+INT physical damage (2+3).

<h3>Damage Resistance, Weakness, and Vulnerability</h3>
<p>
Creatures can be <strong>resistant </strong>to damage, this means when they take
damage it is divided by 2 rounded down. Damage can never be rounded down below
1. If a creature is hit for 3 fire damage and it is resistant to fire damage it
will suffer 1 fire damage.
</p>
<p>
If a creature is <strong>weak </strong>to a damage type then they suffer the
total damage plus 50% (half the damage, round down, and add it to the total
damage).
</p>
<p>
If a creature is <strong>vulnerable </strong>to a damage type then they suffer
double the total damage.
</p>
<p>
If a creature is <strong>immune </strong>to a damage type then they suffer no
damage at all.
</p>
<p>
If a creature is immune to a damage type this cannot be altered, regardless of
abilities that might try to make them weak or vulnerable to a damage type. There
may still be some abilities that can temporarily overcome this damage immunity -
such as Poisoned Strike.

Scale</strong>

   <td>Weak

  </tr>
</table>
<p>
Vulnerable, weak, normal, and resistant work on a sliding scale, where gaining
resistance to a damage type will move you one step to the right on the scale,
and becoming weak to a damage type will move you one step left on the scale.
Becoming vulnerable to a damage type will move you two steps to the left on the
scale. You cannot be moved off this scale. Sources of damage resistance and
vulnerability must be unique - they cannot both come from the same ability or
source type (such as a potion), as they will not stack.
</p>
<h3>Falling Damage</h3>
<p>
No damage up to 10ft. 5 damage if the creature falls 15ft or more. Increases by
additional 5 damage for every 5ft above 15ft. You can easily calculate damage
taken from falling damage by subtracting 10 from the number of ft fallen - that
is the damage suffered. For example 30ft would be 20 damage, 45ft would be 35
damage etc.
</p>
<p>
When a creature suffers falling damage, it is also knocked <em>prone</em> -
unless it is immune or the GM deems it reasonable for the creature to not fall
<em>prone</em>.
</p>
<h2>Death</h2>
<p>
If you are reduced to 0 hit points you die. There are some limited ways to be
brought back to life.
</p>
<h2>Conditions</h2>
<p>
Conditions are always written in <em>italics</em>. Conditions and ability
effects always last until the start of the creature’s next turn that was the
source of the condition (1 round), unless stated otherwise. Many positive
conditions can be permanent.
</p>
<p>
No creature can have 2 instances of the same condition on them - if a creature
is for example currently <em>stunned </em>and then <em>stunned </em>again, the
condition is re-applied with the new duration. This re-application is classed as
a new condition as the old condition is removed.

<h2>Mounted Combat</h2>
<p>
When mounted on a willing creature which is larger than you, you can control it
by spending AP as normal using the creature’s movement speed. Attacks made while
mounted are made with DisAdv (-). You cannot use movement abilities with the
creature, however you can dismount as part of the ability use and leave your
mount behind. More challenging manoeuvres might require a skill check (GM’s
discretion) - having a relevant skill or trait might remove this requirement.
</p>
<h1></h1>
<h1>Class Tables</h1>
<h3>Level Column Key</h3>
<p>
The number describes the level in this class at which these abilities are
unlocked and possible to be gained by a character.
</p>
<p>
“Core” in the level column means that the ability is a core ability and is
automatically unlocked at level 1 in the class and can be used unlimited times
(unless stated otherwise).
</p>
<h3>Description Column Key</h3>
<p>
The first sentence is flavour text.
</p>
<p>
If the description states “make a weapon attack”, on a hit you always deal
weapon damage as part of that attack unless stated otherwise.
</p>
<p>
If damage type is not specified, it is physical damage.
</p>
<p>
Conditions are shown in <em>italics</em>.
</p>
<h3>Target Column Key</h3>
<p>
This column concisely describes what and how the ability assigns targets, range,
and description of AoE. These details will all still be present in the
description column.
</p>
<p>
First part is who can it target:
</p>
<p>
	Self (Self) - Can only target self.
</p>
<p>
	Allies (A) - Target willing creatures of your choice excluding self.
</p>
<p>
	Enemies (E) - Target non willing creatures of your choice excluding self.
</p>
<p>
	All (All) - Target all creatures including self.
</p>
<p>
	Not Applicable (-)
</p>
<p>
Second part is range:
</p>
<p>
	Melee Range (Melee)
</p>
<p>
	Short Range (Short)
</p>
<p>
	Long Range (Long)
</p>
<p>
	Use Equipped Weapon Range (Weapon) This may specify Melee or Ranged only.
</p>
<p>
	Or Specific Range e.g. (30ft)
</p>
<p>
Third part is other specific descriptions:
</p>
<p>
	E.g. All within 40ft straight line from self (AoE)
</p>
<p>
	E.g. Single target
</p>
<p>
	E.g. Up to 3 targets
</p>
<p>
	E.g. All within range (AoE)
</p>
<p>
All of these parts are optional but they will appear in this order.
</p>
<h3>AP Cost Column Key</h3>
<p>
All abilities with an AP cost are limited to 3 uses, unless “Core” is written in
the level column - these can be used unlimited times (unless stated otherwise).
</p>
<p>
A number describes the AP cost.
</p>
<p>
“Pass” means the ability is passive and is always taking effect.
</p>
<p>
“React” means the ability uses your reaction and has unlimited uses (unless it
also has an AP cost - which takes priority and is limited to 3 uses).
</p>

<h1>Appendix</h1>
<h2>Styling Guide</h2>
<h3>Abilities</h3>
<p>
Ability description should consist of:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Flavour sentence
<li>The type of attack roll (e.g. Melee weapon attack)
<li>Targeting and range of the ability
<li>The effects of the ability
<li>(Optional) Duration of the ability
<li>(Optional) Additional rules and clarifications
<li>(Optional) Cost to resist and what is resisted
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Here are a few examples of where this is done:
</p>
<p>
    Strike low and take their feet out from under them. Make a melee weapon
attack against a creature. On a hit, the creature is knocked <em>prone </em>and
then <em>hobbled </em>for one turn. 2 FORT points to resist the <em>prone</em>,
1 FORT point to resist the <em>hobble</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Conjure a short range blast to escape your enemies. Make an INT based melee
attack against a creature. This attack deals Heavy+INT force damage and you are
moved up to 20ft directly away from the target. No attacks of opportunity are
provoked.
</p>
<p>
    Create illusory bindings that lock a foe in place. Select a creature within
100ft and <em>immobilise </em>them. 2 WILL points to resist the
<em>immobilise</em>, if they resist they are <em>hobbled</em>. 1 WILL point to
resist the <em>hobble</em>, if they resist they suffer Light psychic damage.
</p>
<h2>Ability Balance Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li>In most cases 1AP abilities should not be a consistent source of additional
damage, where 2AP and 3AP abilities can/should.
<li>AoE conditions should cost 1 resistance point to resist the effect where
single target conditions should cost 2.
<li>Abilities that deal bonus damage should be conditional on some other
effect/situation. They should not be a consistent source of additional damage.
<li>There should be no abilities that everyone would want. But if they are very
tempting to all players (which is still likely) they should appear late in
specific classes so the player must invest to gain benefit.
<li>As a rough guide, each class should have a range that almost all abilities
adhere to. For example Arcane abilities have 100ft range where Elemental
abilities have 50ft range. This will still vary for some specific abilities.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Optional Rules</h2>
<h3>Optional Tactician Mode: </h3>
<p>
WARNING NOT TESTED - You (the GM) may choose to have all creatures have 5AP per
turn. This is currently untested and not necessarily balanced. Some boss
creatures may already use this system. It works for bosses and not necessarily
for players due to the wealth of abilities that the players have available -
there may be exploitable combinations that were not considered when making the
whole game a 3 AP system.
</p>
<h2>Design Choice Explanations</h2>
<h3>The Dice</h3>
<p>
Why a 2d12 system? Using 2d12 and summing the dice gives a centre weighted
distribution of results (similar to a normal/Gaussian distribution), as opposed
to a d20 or d100 system that has uniform distribution. This probability
distribution makes roll results more consistent, much more like you’d expect in
real life, meaning you can put greater trust in the result of your skill checks
and attack rolls.
</p>
<p>
Why 2d12 instead of 2d10 or 1d20 or 2d20 or 4d6 or 2d6? The d12 is a more
pleasant die to use than the d10, a single d20 gives us a uniform distribution
(which we want to avoid) and prevents the use of our advantage system, 2d20
begins to make the maths a little more complex, 4d6 is more dice and more maths
with little benefit, 2d6 has too little range meaning we couldn’t add 2
modifiers - or if we did they would have to be very small and this would also
reduce potential character progression.
</p>
<p>
Why add two modifiers to all rolls? This gives a more fluid system for
determining what attributes a task requires to complete. A common example in D&D
is climbing a wall. On one hand you could argue that Strength is the required
attribute, to pull yourself up. Or you could argue that Dexterity is required to
gracefully use the cracks and holds to find your way up. With this system it can
require both. This gives a much more realistic representation of the attributes
required for a real life task.
</p>
<p>
Why have stacking Adv and DisAdv in this way? Because look how pretty it is.
This way we can have multiple different conditions and circumstances all
affecting the same action and it actually leads to something meaningful in the
game. We also use it to define how proficient you are in a given skill.
