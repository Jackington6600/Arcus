         <a class="version-text" href="https://github.com/Jackington6600/Arcus/releases" target="_blank">Version 1.3</a>
         <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
         <p>
            Arcus is a pen and paper tabletop role playing game (TTRPG). This system is 
            designed for a fantasy adventure setting and draws inspiration from a wide variety of 
            TTRPG, video game, and board game systems to deliver an expressly simple, yet 
            versatile and powerful ruleset. Arcus' unique take on combat and abilities 
            grants players an abundance of choices in fights and in character progression, 
            encourages teamwork, and provides greater tactical depth. 
         </p>
         <p>
            If you like games such as Divinity Original Sin 2, Baldur's Gate 3, or Gloomhaven, 
            and wish there was a way to enjoy their fun combat systems within a simpler, more 
            immersive, and flexible TTRPG - this might be the game for you. If you enjoy 
            Dungeons and Dragons 5e or Pathfinder 2e and want something a little more from combat 
            without too much additional complexity - this might be the game for you.
         </p>
         <p>
            Note: This is an unfinished ruleset and is still under development. Changes
            may occur regularly. All <strong><span class="wip"> yellow </span></strong> text is work that is under
            consideration for tweaks or changes - use with caution. All <strong><span class="avoid"> red
               </span></strong> text (not to be confused with <strong><span class="fort"> this red </span></strong>
            text)
            is unfinished work or ideas that need to be removed or completely reworked
            - should not be used.
         </p>
         <h2 id="How to Play">How to Play</h2>
         <p>
            Play runs very similarly to other TTRPG systems, the game master (GM) creates
            and describes the world, and the player characters (PCs) then say what they want
            their character to do. If the action the PCs wish to take involves some degree
            of difficulty, for example jumping a large gap or avoiding a rock fall, they
            must roll dice to determine if the actions result in success or failure. The GM
            then narrates what happens as a result of the PCs’ actions. Battles, adventures
            and entire stories can be told using this simple back and forth system.

            The difference between success and failure is not always clear cut. The degree
            of success and failure can depend on the difference between the roll result and
            the DC. This degree of success is determined entirely by the GM but should be
            consistent.
         </p>
         <h3 id="Dice System">Dice System</h3>
         <p>
            This game uses a 2d12 system - roll and add the 2d12 values together for a total
            that must be equal to or greater than a given difficulty value (chosen by the
            GM) to be successful.
         </p>
         <p>
            Every 2d12 roll will add 2 modifiers to it. These modifiers will come from a
            creature’s attributes such as strength, dexterity, and intelligence - the same
            attribute can be used twice in the same roll. The attributes used for the roll
            will depend on the GM’s request based on the action being taken.
         </p>
         <h4 id="Examples">Examples</h4>
         <p>
            Let’s take a warrior with +3 strength modifier, +1 dexterity modifier, and +0
            perception modifier. If they want to take an action such as kicking down a door,
            the GM would ask them to make a “strength plus strength check”. This means the
            warrior will roll 2d12 as always and add their strength modifier twice to the
            roll (+6 total modifier bonus). If the warrior wants to pick a lock, the GM
            might ask them to make a “dexterity plus perception check” so the warrior will
            roll 2d12 and add their dexterity and perception modifiers to the roll (+1 total
            modifier bonus).

         <h4 id="Advantage and Disadvantage">Advantage and Disadvantage</h4>
         <p>
            Advantage (Adv) and disadvantage (DisAdv) range from -3 (---) to +3 (+++) and
            can be applied to a roll/check being made. The table below describes what effect
            Adv and DisAdv have on a roll.

         <p>
            Sources of Adv and DisAdv vary greatly, such as attacking from high ground, or a
            benefit granted by an ability. You will only ever use 2 dice values to get the
            total for a roll.
         </p>
         <p>
            Adv/DisAdv is often displayed as a series of (+) or (-) signs in brackets and
            these cancel each other out. As an example, an ability grants a warrior Adv (++)
            on their next attack. Other circumstances, such as a cloud of smoke, mean that
            the attack also has DisAdv (-). This results in (++-) for the attack roll. The
            (-) then cancels one (+) to give the final result of (+) for the attack roll.
         </p>
         <h4 id="Critical Successes & Critical Failures">Critical Successes & Critical Failures</h4>
         <p>
            A critical success is when the 2 dice used for the roll result each have a value
            of 10 or more (double digits).
         </p>
         <p>
            A critical failure is when the 2 dice used for the roll result each have a value
            of 3 or less.
         </p>
         <p>
            Critical successes will often result a success with some additional bonus (GM may rule some checks as 
            impossible even with a critical success). Critical failures will always fail the check regardless of 
            the modifiers added and the DC, sometimes with some additional negative effect. It is up to the GM 
            to decide how they wish to handle critical success and failure in their game - it should be consistent. 
         </p>
         <p>
            See Attacking section for rules on critical successes and failures when 
            attacking. 
         </p>
         <h4 id="Inspiration">Inspiration</h4>
         <p>
            Throughout the game, players can earn inspiration points. This is gained either
            by certain traits (General: Inspiring), magic items, or most commonly as a
            reward by the DM for when a player does something really cool. A player role
            plays a speech well before a battle? Inspiration! A player thinks of a really
            clever way to get round a trap, but still comes down to a check? Inspiration!
            <br><br>The GM can give this inspiration directly to the action,
            or to the players to use when they see fit. This can then be used in a skill
            check or attack roll to give them Adv (+) where appropriate. Adv (+) is only a
            small buff to the roll but can still feel like a great way to be rewarded and
            can be given out to players quite liberally.

         <h3 id="Step 1 - Who Do You Want To Be?">Step 1 - Who Do You Want To Be?</h3>
         <p>
            There are many ways to start making your character in Arcus and the rules should
            accommodate whatever fantasy character you wish to create (within reason). In
            particular, the species you decide to be makes little difference to the
            capabilities of your character so there are no restrictions. You should still
            discuss with your GM what species there are and how being this species might affect
            your character’s life. Your species also won't give you any significant bonuses
            such as extra arms or the ability to fly, but you can discuss how to make it
            fair and realistic with your GM in the form of 
            <a href="https://jackington6600.github.io/Arcus/#Ancestral%20Traits">Ancestral Traits</a>.            
         </p>
         <p>
            Below are some suggestions on where to start, we recommend starting with 1. and
            going through our step by step guide, but you can read through each and find
            your preference.
         </p>
         <ol>
            <li>You could start by imagining up the flavour of character first - such as a
               cunning lizardman rogue with an obsession for doodling, or a proud steam powered
               golem paladin on a mission to find their creator, or a fun loving human mage
               with an affinity for protecting their friends and destroying things with fire.
               You’re looking for a main characteristic, a species, a class, and a goal. With this
               you can go through character creation starting with Attributes (step 2), working
               out which attributes, skills, traits, classes, and abilities best suit what you
               are trying to make.
            <li>You could instead start with the mechanics - what sort of playstyle you want
               to achieve, and what abilities you want your character to have. Do you want them
               to be a support role with healing and party boosting effects? Maybe look into
               Arcane or Mortality classes. Would you rather play as a brutish tank with crowd
               control and melee capabilities? Look into Warrior or even Elemental if you want
               to add a flair of magic. Go to the Classes section (step 5) first for summaries
               of each class and what they can help you create.
            <li>You could start with your character’s personality and backstory. Perhaps you
               want to write a story about how your character, a humble miller, daughter of a
               miller, becomes a warrior on a path for vengeance after her village is
               plundered. How this influenced her to be cynical about the world and distrusting
               of others - she’s had to become independent but now needs help and is struggling
               with the idea of attachment. Go to the Personality and History section (step 8)
               to get started with this stage of character creation.
            </li>
         </ol>
         <h3 id="Step 2 - Attributes">Step 2 - Attributes</h3>
         <p>
            Attributes outline your character’s core physical and mental capabilities. Is
            your character strong or weak? Fast or slow? Smart or simple? Confident or shy?
            These questions will help you work out your character’s attributes.
         </p>
         <p>
            There are 6 main attributes that all creatures and characters will have:
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong><span class="fort">Strength (STR)</span></strong> - a character's physical strength and brute
            force. In addition to strength based skill checks, your strength modifier (STR) can be used for all melee weapons,
            and to reduce incoming damage with a shield.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong><span class="fort">Constitution (CON)</span></strong> - a combination of the character's overall
            health and endurance. In addition to constitution based skill checks, your starting Hit Points are three times your
            constitution value. Later on, your HP will increase if you increase your CON attribute or if you take the 
            legendary ability: Legendary Endurance.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong><span class="refl">Dexterity (DEX)</span></strong> - a character's hand-eye coordination, balance,
            and overall grace. In addition to dexterity based skill checks, your dexterity modifier (DEX) can be used for light and
            medium melee weapons, thrown weapon attacks, and to increase you Armour Class (AC).
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong><span class="refl">Perception (PER)</span></strong> - a character's senses/awareness, ability to
            aim, and their instinctive ability to pick up on details. In addition to perception based skill checks, your perception
            modifier is used for ranged weapons and your initiative - how early you go in combat. 
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong><span class="will">Intelligence (INT)</span></strong> - a character's logic and reasoning
            capabilities as well as memory and knowledge. In addition to intelligence based skill checks, your intelligence modifier
            (INT) is used for some spells, and every additional modifier grants you an additional skill at (+) level.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong><span class="will">Spirit (SPI)</span></strong> - a character's mental resolve, confidence and
            creativity. In addition to spirit based skill checks, your spirit modifier (SPI) is used for some spells, and every 
            additional modifier grants you an additional resistance point of your choice.
         </p>
         <p>
            Attribute values commonly range from 10 to 24, where 12 roughly describes the
            average human capability, but can range from 1 to 30 in some creatures. The
            value of the attribute will generate a modifier that can be added to dice rolls.
         </p>
         <p>
            At level 1 you have a value 10 in each attribute and 14 points to put into them
            as you wish. At level 1 the max value you can have in an attribute is 15. 
            For example, at level 1 you could make a character
            with 15 Strength, 14 Constitution, 13 Dexterity, 10 Perception, 10 Intelligence,
            and 12 Spirit.
         </p>
         <p>
            Below is a table of the attribute values and the modifier you will have based on
            the value.

            In some rare cases your GM may allow you to drop an attribute score below 10,
            but this should be for roleplaying purposes only - as 10 is already below
            average. You also cannot reduce your attributes in a way that would lead to you
            having negative resistance points (see next section).
         </p>
         <h3 id="Step 3 - Resistance Points">Step 3 - Resistance Points</h3>
         <p>
            Resistance points are a resource that you will spend to prevent incoming
            negative effects, resist damage, and empower your abilities. You regain them all after a long rest.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong><span class="fort">Fortitude (FORT)</span></strong> - the ability to resist negative effects using
            your strength and constitution - such as a sturdy stance to avoid being knocked
            over by a sweeping attack, or a poisonous gas having no effect on you.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong><span class="refl">Reflex (REFL)</span></strong> - the ability to resist negative effects using
            your dexterity and perception - such as dodging an explosion of fire or a hail
            of arrows.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong><span class="will">Will (WILL)</span></strong> - the ability to resist negative effects using your
            intelligence and spirit - such as focusing your mind to avoid being manipulated
            by a spell, or having the confidence to not become frightened.
         </p>
         <h4 id="How Many Resistance Points Do I Have?">How Many Resistance Points Do I Have?</h4>
         <p>
            Next calculate your resistance points from your attributes. To calculate how
            many you have, subtract 10 from each related attribute value, then add the two
            numbers together.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong><span class="fort">Fortitude (FORT)</span></strong> - your <span class="fort">strength</span> value
            -10
            added to your <span class="fort">constitution</span> value -10.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong><span class="refl">Reflex (REFL)</span></strong> - your <span class="refl">dexterity</span> value
            -10 added to your
            <span class="refl">perception</span> value -10.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong><span class="will">Will (WILL)</span></strong> - your <span class="will">intelligence</span> value
            -10 added to your <span class="will">spirit</span>
            value -10.
         </p>
         <p>
            For example, a character with 15 STR and 12 CON has 5 points in STR and 2 in
            CON, so has (5+2) 7 FORT resistance points.
         </p>
         <p>
            You also gain additional resistance points to assign as you wish equal to your
            SPI modifier. A creature with +2 SPI modifier will have 2 additional resistance
            points to assign as they wish, such as 1 extra FORT point and 1 extra WILL
            point. When your SPI modifier increases you may assign the additional resistance
            points freely.
         </p>
         <h4 id="How Do I Use Resistance Points?">How Do I Use Resistance Points?</h4>
         <p>
            There are 4 ways to spend resistance points:
         </p>
         <h5 id="Resisting Incoming Effects">Resisting Incoming Effects</h5>
         <p>
            Throughout the game, you will be inflicted with negative effects from traps, attacks, incoming spells etc. 
            You can spend resistance points to reduce or prevent these negative effects.

            To resist an incoming effect, the GM will tell you the types of resistance points you may spend (FORT, REFL, and/or WILL)
            and a difficulty rating (DR). 
            You may then choose to spend as many resistance points of those types as you wish and then roll
            a number of d12s equal to the number of resistance points spent. To
            resist it you will need to roll a number of successes equal to or greater than the DR.
            You get 1 success for rolling 4 or higher on a d12, and 2 successes for rolling 10 or higher on a d12 (double digits).
            Therefore you get no successes for rolling 3 or lower. Simply add the number of successes on the d12s rolled and 
            compare to the DR - you completely resist the effect described if you roll a number of successes equal to or greater than the DR, 
            or you are inflicted with the effect if you roll lower.
         </p>
         <p>
            The expected result of rolling 1d12 will be 1 success, with a small chance of getting 0 successes, and the same small chance to
            get 2 successes. 
         </p>
         <p>
            Spending resistance points equal to the DR is normally recommended. 
            Spending one extra resistance point is recommended if you really want to resist the incoming effect at an extra cost.
            Spending 1 fewer is risky, but recommended if you care less about being inflicted with the effect and don't want to automatically 
            fail the roll. If you have no resistance points to spend, or simply don't want to spend any, you cannot attempt to resist  
            and are inflicted with the effect without a roll. It may be wise to save resistance points to avoid nastier effects and 
            to be able to resist incoming damage to avoid death.
         </p>
         <h5 id="Resisting Incoming Damage">Resisting Incoming Damage</h5>
         <p>
            You may spend 6 resistance points of any types to make yourself resistant to 
            a single instance of incoming damage (half damage) - this resistance ignores any other vulnerabilities
            or weaknesses you have affecting you and enforces resistance. You can do this at any time and it does not cost a
            reaction. If you are reduced to 0 HP when this is used, you are instead set to 1 HP
            and fall unconscious until another creature uses the help action for 1 minute on you.
            You may also choose to fall unconscious when you resist damage in this way, such as: If the damage
            would still leave you on very low HP after resisting and you want to avoid the risk of being seen as a threat.
         </p>
         <p>
            However, the GM may ask you to describe how you resist the damage. This gives
            the player an opportunity to describe the cool and heroic actions of their
            character to avoid the damage/effect. It also gives the GM the opportunity, in
            some very rare cases, to deny the damage reduction if it cannot make sense for
            the damage to the character to be resisted, or come to a reasonable middleground.
            Such as if the player is <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>paralysed</a> 
            and suffers damage the player cannot resist
            the damage, but if it would kill them the GM can still let the player drop to 1 HP and
            fall <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>unconscious</a> instead. 
            Or in even rarer cases such as being crushed by a wave
            of magma the player might have no chance of survival and die instantly. Note to
            GMs, don’t crush your players with waves of magma - that’s mean.
         </p>
         <h5 id="Empowering Your Abilities">Empowering Your Abilities</h5>
         <p>
            You may spend your resistance points to empower your abilities to make their 
            effects more likely to succeed. When you use an ability with an effect that costs resistance 
            points to resist, immediately before the creature attempts to resist, you may  
            spend up to 3 resistance points of any type to increase the DR of the ability by the same number. If the ability can cause multiple effects 
            that cost resistance points to resist, you must spend additional resistance points 
            for each effect separately. For AoE abilities 
            you may do this to any creatures of your choosing in the AoE, but you must 
            spend resistance points for each creature separately.
         </p>
         <h5 id="Empowering Your Resistance Drain">Empowering Your Resistance Drain</h5>
         <p>
            When you use the Resistance Drain core ability on a creature, 
            you may spend up to 3 resistance points of any type to increase the 
            resistance points drained from this creature by the same number.

         </p>
         <h4 id="Important Notes For The GM">Important Notes For The GM</h4>
         <p>
            Enemies and creatures by default should not be able to spend resistance points to resist 
            damage. They also should not be able to use the resistance drain core ability, 
            spend resistance points to empower abilities, or spend resistance points to empower 
            their resistance drain.
         </p>
         <p>
            The player can choose not to spend their resistance points and save them for
            later effects or damage reduction etc. However, we strongly recommend  that the 
            GM's monsters and NPCs always spend the recommend resistance point cost -  
            if they have fewer available than the recommended cost they should still 
            always spend their resistance points even if it would have no effect. For example, 
            if the ability costs 5 FORT points to resist, and the creature has 2 FORT remaining, it should 
            still spend all 2 FORT points as it fails to resist the effect (the max number of successes 
            from 2d12 is 4). The creatures 
            may spend 1 extra resistance point to automatically succeed. This is done to 
            allow players to spend their abilities to weaken enemies by forcing them to 
            spend their resistance points and to avoid GM creatures metagaming, and avoid 
            confusion around enemies choosing not to resist effects.
         </p>
         <p>
            We also recommend that resistance points of enemies and creatures should be visible to the
            players. This ensures that the players can know whether or not their ability will
            have an effect before they use it. It adds a layer of consistency to
            combat and prevents players from being disappointed when their ability is
            unexpectedly resisted. You can perhaps do this in more vague terms rather than
            giving specific values depending on how you want to play. For example “the
            monster looks very tough and well fortified, but slow and unintelligent”, would
            mean the monster has high FORT but low REFL and WILL. We also recommend that 
            you inform players just before they use an ability that is unlikely to work because 
            the creature has many resistance points in that area.
         </p>
         <p>
            In general creatures will have far fewer resistance points than the players - this 
            is because creatures will only be using their resistance points for this encounter, 
            where the player's resistance points will need to last them the entire day. 
            Some bosses may have significantly more however. For example, most basic creatures will have 0 or 1 resistance
            points in at least 1 or 2 areas. These weaknesses should make sense based on the
            character and type the creature. A light and nimble bandit may have 4 REFL
            points and 0 WILL or FORT. While a spellcaster may have 4 WILL and 0 FORT or
            REFL.
         </p>
         <h3 id="Step 4 - Hit Points">Step 4 - Hit Points</h3>
         <p>
            Your Hit Points (HP) or Health at level 1 is equal to your Constitution Attribute value
            multiplied by 3. So a Consitution of 15 results in 45 HP at level 1.
         </p>
         <p>
            <!-- Every odd level after first (3, 5, 7, 9 etc.) you gain 4 additional Hit Points.   -->
            You can increase your Hit Points further every 5 levels with the legendary ability: Legendary Endurance.
         </p>
         <h4 id="Temporary Hit Points">Temporary Hit Points</h4>
         <p>
            Temporary hit points (Temp HP) last until the start of the turn of the creature
            that granted the Temp HP - unless stated otherwise. They act as normal HP but
            are always used before regular HP. You may have multiple sources of Temp HP and
            these should be kept separate - the creature with the Temp HP can choose which
            pool is used first.
         </p>
         <h3 id="Step 5 - Classes">Step 5 - Classes</h3>
         <p>
            Every level a character has allows 1 point/level to be assigned to a class of
            their choice. Classes are either physical or magical and placing points in them
            allows a character to unlock abilities relating to that class. Putting levels
            into multiple classes is actively encouraged, and there is no restriction or
            downside to which you choose and the order in which you progress in them.

            Abilities and spells that do not mention a weapon (such as most abilities from
            magical classes) do not require a weapon of any kind - they can even be
            performed without a free hand. Therefore, you can wield weapons and cast spells
            at the same time. Each magical class also has 1 or 2 abilities that have
            unlimited uses which can be used as a regular attack instead of using a weapon.
         </p>
         <h3 id="Step 6 - Skills & Traits">Step 6 - Skills & Traits</h3>
         <p>
            Level 1 characters start with 4 skills or traits of their choice (explained
            below), each skill at a proficient (+) level and they must meet the requirements
            of the chosen traits. Every odd level after this (3, 5, 7 … 19) 1 additional
            point is gained to either spend on an additional skill proficiency level, or an
            additional trait.
         </p>
         <p>
            Characters also gain additional skills equal to their INT modifier. These can
            only be used to become proficient (+), and cannot be spent to become expert (++)
            or master (+++).
         </p>
         <h4 id="Skills">Skills</h4>
         <p>
            Skills are normally 1 or 2 words that describe something your character can do
            particularly well, regardless of the attributes needed for the task. Look at the
            Skill Ideas section below and consider the following questions when deciding
            what skills your character might have: What has your character grown up doing?
            What work have they done? What are they good at? What task might they be faced
            with that they can do better than most? You should always discuss with your GM
            what might be good skills to have, that aren’t too general or too specific.
         </p>
         <p>
            Each character will have a list of skills, each one ranging in degree of
            expertise:
         </p>
         <p>
            Proficient (+)
         </p>
         <p>
            Expert (++)
         </p>
         <p>
            Master (+++)
         </p>
         <p>
            The (+) notation describes the degree of Adv they will get on rolls/checks
            involving that skill. For example, the GM asks a warrior to “make a strength
            plus strength check to jump the gap”. The warrior is an expert (++) in athletics
            so they ask the GM if they can use their athletics for the check, the GM deems
            this appropriate and allows it. The warrior then makes the check with Adv (++)
            adding their strength modifier twice.
         </p>
         <p>
            The attributes used for the same skill may vary. For example if the same warrior
            as detailed above wants to run, jump, and duck past a couple of obstacles, the
            GM may ask them to “make a strength plus dexterity check to run and avoid the
            obstacles”. The GM will still allow the warrior to use their athletics skill,
            giving them Adv (++) on the roll and then adding their strength and dexterity
            modifiers.
         </p>
         <p>

         </p>
         <p>
            This is just a list of skill ideas, this should not be taken as the definitive
            list of skills. Remember to discuss with your GM which skills you would like to
            have, and be accepting of adjustments that may need to be made to them so that
            they fit well in the world.

            are primarily non-combat abilities that add flavour and utility to a character or
            creature. Some also have specified requirements that a character must meet to be
            able to unlock the trait. Some are passive, while others are limited to 1 or 3

                  This symbol will have a unique set of markings to identify it so it can be reused, as the symbol 
                  will remain until removed through magical means. It also remains visibly etched into the floor.
                  On completion you may immediately open a gateway to another teleportation symbol

         <p>
            Below are the details on all the potential weapons you might have. Weapons are
            fluid and can be reskinned in many ways - in theory you can think of any fantasy
            weapon and the rules should have a way of putting that into the game. Remember
            that you can wield weapons and cast spells at the same time (no free hand
            required) or go without any weapons and just use spells.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong>Weapon Properties:</strong> Light, Medium, Heavy, One-handed,
            Two-handed, Melee, Versatile, Ranged
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li><strong>Melee weapons</strong> have a range of 5ft, this means you have to
               be adjacent to the enemy to make an attack. Melee attacks will use STR or DEX
               depending on the weapon and the wielder’s choice.
            <li>All <strong>ranged weapons</strong> have DisAdv (-) on attacks made when
               there is a hostile creature within 5ft of you. Ranged only weapons will use PER,
               if the weapon is versatile it will use DEX to be thrown.
            <li><strong>Versatile weapons</strong> can be either used as melee weapons (STR
               or DEX) or as ranged (thrown using DEX).
            <li>There are 3 damage classes of attacks. These are <strong>Light, Medium, and
                  Heavy</strong>. This damage scales with level, and weapons with these
               characteristics have varying properties. See Damage section in Combat for damage
               values.
            <li><strong>Unarmed attacks</strong> are melee only, use STR or DEX to attack
               and deal Light damage. However you cannot add your modifier to the damage. They
               can be “dual-wielded”.
            <li><strong>Light Weapons</strong> are all one-handed. Light weapons are either
               melee, versatile or ranged. If they are melee or versatile they will use STR or
               DEX for melee attacks (wielder’s choice) and DEX for thrown ranged attacks. If
               they are ranged only they will use PER and have long range. All Light versatile
               and ranged weapons will have short range (25ft).
               <ul>
                  <li>Examples of <strong>Light melee</strong> <strong>weapons</strong>: fists or
                     knuckle dusters.
                  <li>Examples of <strong>Light versatile</strong> <strong>weapons</strong>:
                     dagger, handaxe, or an improvised weapon such as a brick.
                  <li>Examples of <strong>Light ranged</strong> <strong>weapons</strong>: hand
                     crossbow, blowdart, or a small firearm.
                  </li>
               </ul>
            <li><strong>Medium melee weapons</strong> are one-handed and can use DEX or STR
               to attack.
               <ul>
                  <li>Examples of Medium melee weapons: longsword, axe, or a mace.
                  </li>
               </ul>
            <li><strong>Medium ranged only weapons</strong> are all two handed, require PER
               to attack, and have long range (100ft).
               <ul>
                  <li>Examples of Medium ranged weapons: bow, crossbow, or an assault rifle.
                  </li>
               </ul>
            <li>Note: Medium weapons cannot be versatile.
            <li><strong>Heavy melee weapons</strong> are all two-handed and require STR to
               use.
               <ul>
                  <li>Examples of Heavy melee weapons: greatsword, greataxe, or a large club.
                  </li>
               </ul>
            <li>Note: Heavy weapons cannot be versatile.
            <li><strong>Dual wielding</strong> can be done with 2 Light weapons, or a Medium
               and a Light weapon. Both must be one-handed. Attacks that involve both weapons
               can make 1 attack roll against a single target - or split into 2 against
               multiple targets, such as melee attack with your main hand melee weapon then
               throw a dagger at a different target with your offhand. Damage is calculated as
               normal for the weapon in the main hand, and the off-hand weapon just adds base
               damage (no additional attribute bonus). Attack rolls while dual wielding with a
               Medium and Light weapon are calculated with a -2 modifier. Attack rolls while
               dual wielding 2 Light weapons are done as normal.
            </li>
         </ul>

            A summary of how the different weapons will work in the game - each weapon can
            be reskinned or flavoured to fit what you want your character to use. For
            example, you might use: knuckle dusters or a simple improvised weapon instead of
            a club; a handaxe, sickle or stiletto instead of a dagger; a rapier, scimitar,
            axe, mace, spear or short staff instead of a sword; a greataxe, greatclub,
            scythe or large spear instead of a greatsword; a crossbow or rifle instead of a
            bow; a blowdart or pistol instead of a light crossbow.

            A shield requires 1 hand to equip (your off hand), and grants an ability with
            unlimited uses. This ability can be used when you suffer any amount of damage,
            but only once per turn (does not use a reaction): It is reduced by your STR
            modifier in damage (minimum 0). This damage reduction occurs before any other
            damage reduction. Auto hit attacks ignore shields.

         <p>
            All characters have their strengths and weaknesses, and in role playing both are
            equally fun. The following questions will help you determine your character’s
            personality - remember that every trait is a sliding scale where your character
            could be anywhere in between these extremes. Are they funny or serious?
            Optimistic or pessimistic? Sociable or quiet? Honest or deceptive? Kind or
            cruel? Passionate or stoic? Collaborative or independent? Open-minded or
            stubborn? Energetic or calm? Spiritual or material? Generous or greedy?
            Respectful or rude? Forgiving or vengeful? Modest or boasting? Creative or
            traditional?
         </p>
         <p>
            You can delve further by asking how your character might behave and react in
            different situations, and asking some more applied personality questions. Would
            your character offer to help someone for free or expect payment? If threatened,
            would your character seek a peaceful outcome or quickly resort to violence?
            Could your character forgive someone for stealing from them, or would they
            demand vengeance? How would your character react to being insulted? What type of
            shop or treasure interests your character? Do you have a role model? What are
            your character’s short and long term motives/goals? Are there any political or
            social views that your character strongly agrees or disagrees with? Are there
            any organisations in the world that your character strongly agrees or disagrees
            with? What are your character’s deepest fears? What are your character’s
            greatest values? What does your character do for fun?
         </p>
         <p>
            Questions to ask about your character’s history - also see the Skills and Traits
            section (step 5). Where is your character from? What is their family like - what
            have they done and where are they now? What major events have occurred during
            your character’s life so far? What have they done in response and how has it
            moulded your character into who they are now? How has that affected their
            motives? What secrets do they have? How did your character gain the attributes
            and class that they are now? Does your character have few or many friends? Are
            any of those friends notable, if so what are they like? What kind of people do
            you trust and mistrust? Does your character have any hobbies?

            various abilities and attacks of opportunity. It can be spent at any point,
            either on your turn or during another creature’s turn.
         </p>
         <h3 id="Movement">Movement</h3>
         <p>
            Your base movement speed is 50ft. However, this can be affected by armour,
            abilities, and equipment. You can spend 1 AP to move up to your base movement
            speed. This movement can be broken up around the other things you do on your
            turn - for example with 50ft of movement you could move 15ft, then attack, then
            move the remaining 35ft.
         </p>
         <h4 id="Difficult Terrain">Difficult Terrain</h4>
         <p>
            It costs 10ft of movement instead of 5ft to move into a tile that is considered
            difficult terrain. Creatures can also move through allies as if they were
            difficult terrain. Creatures cannot move through other hostile creatures.
         </p>
         <h4 id="Types of Movement">Types of Movement</h4>
         <h5 id="Regular Movement">Regular Movement</h5>
         <p>
            Regular movement includes running, walking, and crawling. Generally referred to
            as “move” or “movement”.
         </p>
         <h5 id="Jumping Movement">Jumping Movement</h5>
         <p>
            Jumping movement works the same as regular movement except obstacles (such as
            gaps, low obstacles, or small creatures) can be avoided on the path.
            The distance that can be jumped in ft is equal to the creature's STR value 
            (if in tile based combat, rounded down to a multiple of 5). The height that can be jumped in ft is equal
            to half the creature's STR value (if in tile based combat, rounded down to a multiple of 5).  What can or
            cannot be jumped may be up to the GM’s discretion. The jump may require a roll
            depending on the difficulty, distance, or height of the jump - this will use strength and/or
            dexterity depending on the nature of the jump (strength for greater distance,
            dexterity for greater accuracy). Generally referred to as “jump” or “jumping”.
         </p>
         <h5 id="Climbing Movement">Climbing Movement</h5>
         <p>
            Climbing movement works the same as regular movement but is done up a more
            vertical surface such as up a wall or a tree. What can or cannot be climbed is
            up to the GM’s discretion. The GM will make the creature perform a skill check
            based on the difficulty of the surface they are attempting to climb. If
            successful the creature can climb as if the surface was difficult terrain. The
            creature must repeat the skill check every time it wishes to move its base
            movement speed - it is up to the GM if and when they may need to repeat the
            skill check based on time spent climbing or if the difficulty of the climb
            significantly changes.
         </p>
         <h5 id="Swimming Movement">Swimming Movement</h5>
         <p>
            Swimming movement works the same as regular movement but is done through a
            liquid such as water or slime. What can or cannot be swam through is up to the
            GM’s discretion. The GM will make the creature perform a skill check based on
            the difficulty. If successful the creature can swim as if the liquid was
            difficult terrain - it is up to the GM if and when they may need to repeat the
            skill check based on time spent swimming or if the difficulty of the swim
            significantly changes.
         </p>
         <h5 id="Teleportation Movement">Teleportation Movement</h5>
         <p>
            Teleportation movement allows a creature to move to a point they can see,
            ignoring all obstacles between their start and end point. Teleportation movement
            ignores all movement restrictions the creature might have (<a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>immobilised</a> or 
            <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>hobbled</a> specifically). Teleportation movement happens
            instantaneously and cannot be broken up throughout a turn. A creature can
            teleport to a point in mid-air. Generally referred to as “teleport”,
            “teleportation” or “teleported”.
         </p>
         <h5 id="Flying Movement">Flying Movement</h5>
         <p>
            Flying movement allows movement in all directions including directly and
            diagonally up and down. A creature can only fly if they have a flying movement
            speed. Some abilities or transformations can unlock a flying movement speed.
         </p>
         <p>
            A flying creature does not have to end its movement on the ground - it does not
            fall or suffer falling damage while flying. If the creature is knocked <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>prone</a> 
            or <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>stunned</a> 
            they are no longer flying and will immediately fall at 
            normal speed and suffer fall damage as normal - the creature becomes flying again
            when it spends flying movement speed. Generally referred to as “fly”, “flight”
            or “flying”.
         </p>
         <h5 id="Voluntary Movement">Voluntary Movement</h5>
         <p>
            Movement is considered voluntary if the creature has a choice of how it moves
            and where. Most movement is considered voluntary. For example, base movement, or
            movement gained from a creature’s own abilities or ally’s abilities.
         </p>
         <h5 id="Involuntary Movement">Involuntary Movement</h5>
         <p>
            Movement is considered involuntary if the creature does not have a choice of how
            it moves and where. For example, a hostile pulling, pushing, or teleporting
            another creature, or any movement effect on a creature that it can attempt to
            resist. Movement due to being <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>taunted</a>, <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>frightened</a>, or
            <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>dominated</a> is still considered voluntary movement.
         </p>
         <h5 id="Push/Pull Movement">Push/Pull Movement</h5>
         <p>
            Push/pull movement is always involuntary and ignores difficult terrain and
            movement restrictions the creature might have (<a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>immobilised</a>,
            <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>paralysed</a>, or <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>hobbled</a> specifically) unless the GM
            deems it unreasonable. Generally referred to as “push”, “pushed”, “pull”, or
            “pulled”.

            <p>
            <strong>Collisions</strong>
            <p>
            A collision is when push movement is stopped or blocked by an object or creature. When a collision occurs,
            the creature being pushed suffers Light damage and the movement ends. If multiple creatures are all being pushed by the same 
            ability, these movements happen simultaneously and movement may be stopped, but no damage is suffered.
         </p>
         <h3 id="Attacking">Attacking</h3>
         <p>
            To attack you roll 2d12 and add 2 modifiers (such as DEX+DEX, STR+STR, or
            PER+PER).
         </p>
         <p>
            A melee INT attack would add INT+INT to the roll for example.
         </p>
         <p>
            To hit the target you must roll equal to or higher than their armour class (AC).
            If you use any ability which requires an attack roll you still hit if you roll lower than
            the target's AC, and deal half damage (glancing damage) instead - you still always miss
            if you critically fail the attack roll.
         </p>
         <h4 id="Types of Attack Roll">Types of Attack Roll</h4>
         <ul>
            <li><strong>Weapon, melee, ranged, or auto hit.</strong>
               <ul>
                  <li><strong>Weapon attack</strong> uses your equipped weapon to make the attack
                     roll.
                  <li><strong>Melee weapon attack</strong> uses your equipped melee weapon to make
                     the attack roll.
                  <li><strong>Ranged weapon attack</strong> uses your equipped ranged weapon to
                     make the attack roll - will have DisAdv (-) if you are within melee range of a
                     hostile creature. If this type of attack is made against
                     a target that is at least 10ft above the attacker, the attack is made with 
                     DisAdv (-), also an attack made against a target 10ft below the attacker, the
                     attack is made with Adv (+).
                  <li><strong>Melee attack</strong> uses melee range to make the attack roll but
                     does not require a melee weapon. This could include a magical punch attack,
                     which does not require a free hand.
                  <li><strong>Ranged attack</strong> uses the described range to make the attack
                     roll but does not require a ranged weapon - will have DisAdv (-) if you are
                     within melee range of a hostile creature. If this type of attack is made against
                     a target that is at least 10ft above the attacker, the attack is made with 
                     DisAdv (-), also an attack made against a target 10ft below the attacker, the
                     attack is made with Adv (+).
                     This could include a magical ranged attack, which does not require a free hand.
                  <li><strong>Versatile attack</strong> uses the described range to make the
                     attack roll - has no disadvantages due to hostile creatures within melee range.
                     This could include a magical ability, which does not require a free hand.
                  <li><strong>Auto hit attack</strong> does not require an attack roll and always
                     hits. Auto hit also ignores a shield - the shield cannot reduce damage from this
                     attack.
                  </li>
               </ul>
            <li><strong>STR, DEX, PER, INT, or SPI.</strong>
               <ul>
                  <li>Describes the attribute modifier used to make the attack roll. Can also be
                     described as MOD if there are multiple attribute modifiers that could be used.
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Regular attack.</strong>
               <ul>
                  <li>An attack is considered a regular attack if it can be made with unlimited uses, 
                     such as attacking with an equipped weapon or using a class core ability. See
                     Regular Attack in the Core Abilities section.
                  </li>
               </ul>

            <li><strong>Ability attack.</strong>
               <ul>
                  <li>An attack is considered an ability attack if it is made as part of an ability with limited uses, 
                     such as using the Sweeping Strike or Ice Spikes abilities. Ability attacks are special because 
                     even if you roll lower than the AC of the target, you still hit and deal glancing damage instead 
                     (deal half damage). See the glancing damage section for more details.
                  </li>

         </ul>
         <h4 id="Attacks of Opportunity">Attacks of Opportunity</h4>
         <p>
            A creature with a melee attack available may choose to spend its reaction to
            make a melee attack against a creature that moves out of melee range. The
            available melee attack can only be from an equipped weapon or core ability (such
            as Elemental Blast).
         </p>
         <p>
            Movement used as part of an ability (such as Charge, Hit and Run, or Advance!),
            involuntary movement (such as being pushed or pulled), or teleportation movement
            does not trigger attacks of opportunity.
         </p>
         <h4 id="Critical Hit">Critical Hit</h4>
         <p>
            A critical success (critical hit) is when the 2 dice used for the roll result each have a value
            of 10 or more (double digits).
         </p>
         <p>
            A critical failure (critical miss) is when the 2 dice used for the roll result each have a value
            of 3 or less.
         </p>
         <p>
            A critical hit on an attack roll always hits the target regardless 
            of modifiers and AC, and you deal critical damage 
            - take the total attack damage and add 50% 
            (half the damage, round down, and add it to the total damage).
            Additional damage from abilities is also not multiplied on a critical
            hit - this will always be described as "additional" damage. Critical damage does not stack and 
            cannot be multiplied more than once.

         </p>
         <p>
            A critical miss always misses the target regardless of the modifiers and AC, and therefore deal 
            no damage. Additional damage from abilities will also not be applied on a critical miss.
         </p>
         <h4 id="Multi-Target Attacks">Multi-Target Attacks</h4>
         <p>
            When using a multi-target ability (for example scatter shot or whirlwind) roll
            one attack roll as normal and compare the outcome to all targets’ AC. If you
            have Adv or DisAdv against one or more of the targets, roll separately for those
            targets and then compare to AC and apply damage as normal.
         </p>
         <h4 id="Holding Attacks">Holding Attacks</h4>
         <p>
            Sometimes you want to wait for exactly the right moment to attack, for example a
            dragon swooping down into range. You have the option to spend the 2AP to choose
            a weapon attack or core ability attack (not an expendable ability) and describe
            who you want it to target and when you want it to trigger. For example, “when
            the rat pops its head out of the hole” or “when the eagle gets within grabbing
            distance”, not “when I next see an enemy”. If this happens before the start of
            your next turn, you can choose to spend your reaction to make the attack. If you
            choose not to, or your trigger conditions are not met before the start of your
            next turn you lose the held attack.
         </p>
         <h4 id="Surprise">Surprise</h4>
         <p>
            If you are <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>hidden</a> from a creature 
            and make an attack against it, you will
            have Adv (++) on the attack roll and the attack may also deal critical damage due to surprise.
            An attack can be considered as a surprise 
            when a creature that is not expecting a violent threat of any kind, such as 
            not being involved in combat of any kind and unaware of your presence. 
            After this, the attacked creature and other
            creatures in the area will become aware of your presence - such
            as the target shouting to their allies to warn them about you - and you will 
            no longer be <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>hidden</a>.
         </p>
         <p>
            Also if the target is aware of you but is strongly not expecting you to attack
            them, this may also class as a surprise in some circumstances, gaining Adv (++) 
            and dealing critical damage. For example, betraying an ally stood beside you to initiate combat.
         </p>
         <h4 id="Concealment">Cover & Concealment</h4>
         <p>
            A ranged attack against a creature you can see and make a valid attack against but has over 3/4 of it's body covered
            by terrain or an obstacle is known as <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>in cover</a>.  All attacks against this enemy is made with DisAdv (-).
            Marking a target removes it's cover bonus.
         </p>
         <p>
            To be considered <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>hidden</a> from another certain creature, the creature must not be able to see you and therefore be 
            unaware of your presence or current location. This might come from making a successful Hide core ability, or from being <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>invisible</a>. 
            An attack against a creature that you are <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>hidden</a> from has Adv (++). This grade of Adv may vary based on GM's discretion. 
            Being <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>hidden</a> can be broken in many ways such as by making noise, being seen, or dealing damage.
         </p>
         <p>
            A melee attack against a target you cannot see (such as when you are <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>blind</a> 
            or the target is <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>invisible</a>) is made with DisAdv (--).
         </p>
         <p>
            A ranged attack against a target you cannot see (such as when you are <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>blind</a> 
            or the target is <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>invisible</a>) is made with DisAdv (---).
         </p>
         <h3 id="Range">Range</h3>
         <p>
            There are 3 classes of range:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li><strong>Melee refers to a range of 5ft.</strong>
            <li><strong>Short range refers to a range of 25ft.</strong>
               <ul>
                  <li>Attempting an attack above this range gives disadvantage: (-) for every
                     additional 25ft (up to a max of an additional 75ft). E.g. (-) up to 50ft and
                     (---) up to 100ft. <br>This range extension can ONLY be done with
                     abilities if it is specified to have “Short” range.
                  </li>
               </ul>
            <li><strong>Long range refers to a range of 100ft.</strong>
               <ul>
                  <li>Attempting an attack above this range gives disadvantage: (-) for every
                     additional 50ft (up to a max of an additional 150ft). E.g. (-) up to 150ft and
                     (--) up to 200ft.<br>This range extension can ONLY be done with abilities
                     if it is specified to have “Long” range.
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            These values will be referred to throughout. If an ability has a specific range
            it can only be used within that range.
         </p>
         <h3 id="Damage">Damage</h3>
         <p>
            Base weapon damage depends on the class of attack or ability you use.  Light, Medium, and Heavy
            damage deal 3, 6, and 9 damage respectively.  You can increase these values with legendary abilities
            every 5 levels.

            To this value you add the appropriate damage modifier. If you used DEX+DEX for

         <h4 id="Critical Damage">Critical Damage</h4>
         <p>
            Critical damage is equal to the total attack damage plus 50% (half the damage, round down, and add it to the total
            damage).

         <p>
            Critically hitting a target will result in the target suffering critical damage 
            (there are some abilities that will also deal critical damage). 
            Additional damage from abilities is also not multiplied on a critical
            hit - this will always be described as "additional" damage. Critical damage does not stack and 
            cannot be multiplied more than once. If damage is both glancing and critical, it is considered as normal 
            damage and is not multiplied.
         </p>
         <h4 id="Glancing Damage">Glancing Damage</h4>
         <p>
            Glancing damage is equal to half the total attack damage. 
         </p>
         <p>
            Glancing damage can occur when you make an attack as part of an ability and roll lower than the AC but 
            do not critically miss. The attack is still a hit but will deal half attack damage. Additional damage is 
            again not affected by glancing and is applied as normal.
         </p>
         <p>
            Other abilities and conditions can also cause glancing damage, but glancing damage does not stack and cannot be 
            multiplied more than once. If damage is both glancing and critical, it is considered as normal 
            damage and is not multiplied.

         <p>
            Creatures can be <strong>resistant</strong> to damage, this means when they suffer
            damage it is divided by 2 rounded down. Damage can never be rounded down below
            1. If a creature is hit for 3 fire damage and it is resistant to fire damage it
            will suffer 1 fire damage.
         </p>
         <p>
            If a creature is <strong>weak</strong> to a damage type then they suffer the
            total damage plus 50% (half the damage, round down, and add it to the total
            damage).
         </p>
         <p>
            If a creature is <strong>vulnerable</strong> to a damage type then they suffer
            double the total damage.
         </p>
         <p>
            If a creature is <strong>immune</strong> to a damage type then they suffer no
            damage at all.
         </p>
         <p>
            If a creature is immune to a damage type this cannot be altered, regardless of
            abilities that might try to make them <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>weak</a> 
            or <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>vulnerable</a> to a damage type. There
            may still be some abilities that can temporarily overcome this damage immunity -
            such as Poisoned Strike.

            After total damage has been calculated by the attacker, the damage can still be reduced or increased
            once with a multiplier using the scale above. You always start at "Normal" and step left and right based
            on your resistances, weaknesses, and vulnerabilities. If there are both resistances and weaknesses the steps 
            cancel each other out as much as they can and use the resulting multiplier.
         </p>
         <p>
            <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>Vulnerable</a>, <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>weak</a>, normal, and resistant work on a sliding scale, where gaining
            resistance to a damage type will move you one step to the left on the scale,
            and becoming <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>weak</a> to a damage type will move you one step right on the scale.
            Becoming <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>vulnerable</a> to a damage type will move you two steps to the right on the
            scale. You cannot be moved off this scale. Sources of damage resistance and
            vulnerability must be unique - they cannot both come from the same ability or
            source type (such as a potion), as they will not stack.
         </p>
         <p>
            For example, if a creature is being hit by 23 fire damage and is vulnerable to fire damage, but has resistance to all damage because of an ability 
            it has used, there are two steps right due to vulnerability and one step left due to the resistance, resulting in 
            one step to the right. Therefore, the creature suffers 34 fire damage (23 + (23/2) = 34).
         </p>
         <h4 id="Falling Damage">Falling Damage</h4>
         <p>
            No damage up to 10ft. 5 damage if the creature falls 15ft or more. Increases by
            additional 5 damage for every 5ft above 15ft. You can easily calculate damage
            suffered from falling damage by subtracting 10 from the number of ft fallen - that
            is the damage suffered. For example 30ft would be 20 damage, 45ft would be 35
            damage etc.
         </p>
         <p>
            When a creature suffers falling damage, it is also knocked <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>prone</a> -
            unless it is <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>immune</a> or the GM deems it reasonable for the creature to not fall
            <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>prone</a>.

         <h3 id="Death">Death</h3>

            If you are reduced to 0 hit points you die. There are some limited ways to be
            brought back to life.
         </p>
         <h3 id="Conditions">Conditions</h3>
         <p>
            Conditions are always written in <em>italics</em> and have a tooltip if you hover over them 
            or tap them on mobile. Conditions and ability
            effects always last until the start of the creature’s next turn that was the
            source of the condition (1 round), unless stated otherwise. Many positive
            conditions can be permanent.
         </p>
         <p>
            No creature can have 2 instances of the same condition on them - if a creature
            is for example currently <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>stunned</a> and then <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>stunned</a> again, the
            condition is re-applied with the new duration. This re-application is classed as
            a new condition as the old condition is removed.

            When mounted on a willing creature which is larger than you, you can control it
            by spending AP as normal using the creature’s movement speed. Attacks made while
            mounted are made with DisAdv (-). You cannot use movement abilities with the
            creature, however you can dismount as part of the ability use and leave your
            mount behind. More challenging manoeuvres might require a skill check (GM’s
            discretion) - having a relevant skill or trait might remove this requirement.

            “Core” in the level column means that the ability is a core ability and is

         <p>
            “React” means the ability uses your reaction and has unlimited uses (unless it
            also has an AP cost - which takes priority and is limited to 3 uses).

         <h4 id="Ability Notes For The GM">Ability Notes For The GM</h4>
         <p>
            You should generally feel free to change the flavour and damage types of abilities
            in these tables to suit the flavour the players wish to achieve. Not every possible
            fantasy can be covered with these ability lists (for now...). It is still best to 
            avoid changing values, such as damage, resist cost, and condition types. These abilities
            should also not be too flexible, outline what they do and lock them in before you
            start a session.
         </p>
         <p>
            An example might be if you have a Psionic player that really wants to push things
            with their mind, you can simply take an ability such as Gust from Elemental, and 
            change the damage type to psychic and resist type to WILL and allow them to take it
            as a level 1 Psionic ability.

                     you (voluntarily or involuntarily), you may deal Light damage to that creature. Each creature can only
                     be damaged by this effect once per cast. This ability has no affect when you are the one moving.

                     tiles and remain for up to 10 minutes, or until you dismiss them on your turn for 0 AP. 
                     Moving onto one of these portal tiles immediately teleports you to a tile of your choice within
                     5ft of the other portal. If there is no space on the other side,
                     you get pushed back to the tile you were in before you entered the portal.
                     All creatures and items can also pass though this portal, so long as they
                     can fit through it. You may only have one pair of portals active at any time.

                     to attack a second creature of your choosing within 100ft.

                  You gain the ability to change form into your unlocked beasts for 1AP (See Beast Form table in the Appendix). While in Beast Form, you can use all the beast's abilities.
                  Core abilities in this table have unlimited uses as normal, and all of the level 1 abilities are automatically 
                  unlocked and are limited to 3 uses every long rest as normal. By default, the Tiny Beast Form
                  is unlocked, and you can unlock others with further levels in the Nature class.
                  You can use Nature abilities while in Beast Form, but abilities from other classes are 
                  unavailable.
               </p><p>
                  When you change form into the beast, your physical attributes and AC change to that of the beast, but your Spirit
                  and Intelligence attributes and all resistance points remain the same - you may use your resistance points as normal.
                  When you change form into the beast you must also choose how much HP you give to the beast,
                  up to that of the max HP of the beast - the amount you give is subtracted from your health pool. When your beast form is reduced to 0 HP, you immediately return to 
                  your original form - any additional damage is carried over and also subtracted from your max HP. 
               </p><p>
                  You can voluntarily leave beast form at any time on your turn for no cost, returning to your original form, and
                  any remaining HP gets returned to your normal health pool.

                  <p>
                     You can create contraptions of 2 types, a trap contraption and a creature contraption.
                     Creature contraptions are treated as creatures and trap contraptions are not.
                     All contraptions last indefinitely until destroyed, similarly to summons.
                     All contraptions you create can be destroyed by suffering damage, they have an AC of 10, and HP of 2xINT (minimum 1). If a
                     trap contraption is destroyed it does not trigger. Only one of each contraption (ability)
                     can persist at any time, any that already exist are destroyed if you cast the ability again. 
                     You may destroy any number of contraptions on your turn 
                     for 0 AP. If contraptions are created while you are <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>hidden</a>,
                     it remains <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>hidden</a> until
                     triggered or until a creature rolls a PER+PER check (or has a higher passive perception) that is higher 
                     than your INT value (not modifier).

                     Many of the engineer’s abilities have multiple AP costs separated by slashes (/), when casting an ability
                     like this you must choose one of the AP costs to spend, and the power of the ability
                     will vary depending on the AP spent. You still expend 1 ability use as normal. For example, 
                     if an ability had a cost of "1/2/3", there might be a section in the description that reads
                     "deal Light/Medium/Heavy damage". This means that if you were to spend 1 AP casting the ability 
                     you would deal Light damage, 2 AP would deal Medium damage, and 3 AP would deal Heavy damage. There
                     may also be other differences explained in the description without slashes (/).

                     (Light/Medium/Heavy)+INT damage. Once this damage is dealt the trap in that tile is destroyed.

                  <p>
                     Your beast has its own "character sheet" found in the Beast Companion Base Stats section and has a separate turn
                     to you as well as its own AP, HP, Resistance Point pools, reaction etc. 
                     Like the creatures that you fight against, your beast will always spend resistance points to attempt
                     to resist incoming effects.
                  <p>
                     On putting your first level in Beastmaster, your beast starts with maximum HP equal to 6.
                     Every further level in Beastmaster increases your beast’s maximum HP by 2.
                     Every time you put a level in Beastmaster you may
                     also decrease your maximum HP by any amount of your choosing to increase your
                     beast’s maximum HP by the same amount - you must still have at least 1 maximum HP.

                     If your beast were to die,
                     you can find (buy, track, tame) a new beast and attune to it over a long rest.
                     Your new beast keeps all of the same stats as the previous - though you may discuss with your GM how
                     your new beast may be different to your previous beast, and adjustments may be
                     available.

                  <p>
                     Heel - your beast stays next to you and tries to stay out of harm’s
                     way. It may still attack if adjacent to a hostile creature.
                  <p>
                     Attack - your beast uses all of its AP to move to the closest enemy and, if possible, attack
                     it. Your beast will attack with a STR or DEX melee attack dealing Light+MOD damage, where MOD is the 
                     same attribute used for the attack.

         </p>
         <p>
            Strike low and take their feet out from under them. Make a melee weapon
            attack against a creature. On a hit, the creature is knocked <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>prone</a> and
            then <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>hobbled</a> for one turn. 2 FORT points to resist the <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>prone</a>,
            1 FORT point to resist the <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>hobble</a>.
         </p>
         <p>
            Conjure a short range blast to escape your enemies. Make an INT based melee
            attack against a creature. This attack deals Heavy+INT force damage and you are
            moved up to 20ft directly away from the target. No attacks of opportunity are
            provoked.
         </p>
         <p>
            Create illusory bindings that lock a foe in place. Select a creature within
            100ft and <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>immobilise</a> them. 2 WILL points to resist the
            <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>immobilise</a>, if they resist they are <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>hobbled</a>. 1 WILL point to
            resist the <a class="condition" data-tooltip-container>hobble</a>, if they resist they suffer Light psychic damage.
         </p>
         <h3 id="Ability Balance Guidelines">Ability Balance Guidelines</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>In most cases 1AP abilities should not be a consistent source of additional
               damage, where 2AP and 3AP abilities can/should.
            <li>AoE conditions should cost 1 resistance point to resist the effect where
               single target conditions should cost 2.
            <li>Abilities that deal bonus damage should be conditional on some other
               effect/situation. They should not be a consistent source of additional damage.
            <li>There should be no abilities that everyone would want. But if they are very
               tempting to all players (which is still likely) they should appear late in
               specific classes so the player must invest to gain benefit.
            <li>As a rough guide, each class should have a range that almost all abilities
               adhere to. For example Arcane abilities have 100ft range where Elemental
               abilities have 50ft range. This will still vary for some specific abilities.

         <h4 id="Optional Tactician Mode">Optional Tactician Mode</h4>
         <p>
            WARNING NOT TESTED - You (the GM) may choose to have all creatures have 5AP per
            turn. This is currently untested and not necessarily balanced. Some boss
            creatures may already use this system. It works for bosses and not necessarily
            for players due to the wealth of abilities that the players have available -
            there may be exploitable combinations that were not considered when making the
            whole game a 3 AP system.

         <h3 id="Design Choice Explanations">Design Choice Explanations</h3>
         <h4 id="The Dice">The Dice</h4>
         <p>
            Why a 2d12 system? Using 2d12 and summing the dice gives a centre weighted
            distribution of results (similar to a normal/Gaussian distribution), as opposed
            to a d20 or d100 system that has uniform distribution. This probability
            distribution makes roll results more consistent, much more like you’d expect in
            real life, meaning you can put greater trust in the result of your skill checks
            and attack rolls.
         </p>
         <p>
            Why 2d12 instead of 2d10 or 1d20 or 2d20 or 4d6 or 2d6? The d12 is a more
            pleasant die to use than the d10, a single d20 gives us a uniform distribution
            (which we want to avoid) and prevents the use of our advantage system, 2d20
            begins to make the maths a little more complex, 4d6 is more dice and more maths
            with little benefit, 2d6 has too little range meaning we couldn’t add 2
            modifiers - or if we did they would have to be very small and this would also
            reduce potential character progression.
         </p>
         <p>
            Why add two modifiers to all rolls? This gives a more fluid system for
            determining what attributes a task requires to complete. A common example in D&D
            is climbing a wall. On one hand you could argue that Strength is the required
            attribute, to pull yourself up. Or you could argue that Dexterity is required to
            gracefully use the cracks and holds to find your way up. With this system it can
            require both. This gives a much more realistic representation of the attributes
            required for a real life task.
         </p>
         <p>
            Why have stacking Adv and DisAdv in this way? Because look how pretty it is.
            This way we can have multiple different conditions and circumstances all
            affecting the same action and it actually leads to something meaningful in the
            game. We also use it to define how proficient you are in a given skill.
