Arcus is a pen and paper tabletop role playing game (TTRPG).

This system draws inspiration from a wide variety of tabletop, video game, and board game systems to deliver a balanced and simple, yet deep and tactical experience compared to other traditional tabletop RPGs.

Arcus’ unique take on combat and character abilities make fights incredibly varied, team based, with great tactical depth and a high skill ceiling. If you like Divinity Original Sin 2, Baldur’s Gate 3, Gloomhaven, or Dungeons and Dragons 5e but wish the combat was more engaging - this might just be the TTRPG for you.
