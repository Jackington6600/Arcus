Arcus is a pen and paper tabletop role playing game (TTRPG).

This system is designed for a fantasy adventure setting and draws inspiration from a wide variety of TTRPG, video game, and board game systems to deliver an expressly simple, yet versatile and powerful ruleset. Arcus' unique take on combat and abilities grants players an abundance of choices in fights and in character progression, encourages teamwork, and provides greater tactical depth. 

If you like games such as Divinity Original Sin 2, Baldur's Gate 3, or Gloom/Frosthaven, and wish there was a way to enjoy their fun combat systems within a simple, immersive, and flexible tabletop RPG format - this might be the game for you. If you enjoy Dungeons and Dragons 5e, Pathfinder 2e, or Draw Steel and want something a little more from combat without too much additional complexity or heroic elements - this might be the game for you.
