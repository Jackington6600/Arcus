                     Make a weapon attack against a creature. On a hit all damage dealt is poison
                     damage and it ignores all damage resistances and immunities. For each resistance
                     type that the creature has no remaining resistance points, it suffers additional
                     Light poison damage.

                  You gain the ability to shapeshift into your unlocked animals for 1AP (See Beast
                  Shape table in the Appendix).  When in the animal form, you can use all the animal abilities.
                  Core abilities have unlimited uses as normal, and all the level 1 abilities are automatically
                  unlocked and are limited to 3 uses every long rest as normal.  By default, the Tiny Animal
                  Beast Shape is unlocked, and you can unlock others with further levels in the Nature class.
                  You can use Nature abilities while in Beast Shape, but abilities from other classes are
                  unavailable.
               </p><p>
                  When you shapeshift into the beast, your physical attributes and AC change, but your Spirit
                  and Intelligence remains the same. You can carry across HP up to that of the max HP of the beast,
                  specified in the Beast table. When you are reduced to 0HP as the beast, you instantly revert back to
                  your original form minus any HP that you had transferred to the beast - any additional damage is also carried
                  over.  In the Beast Shape, you still have and can use your standard pool of resistance points as normal,
                  No further resistance points are gained or lost from the changing attributes in Beast Shape.
               </p><p>
                  You can voluntarily leave the Beast Shape at any time on your turn for 0AP, and
                  any remaining HP gets returned to your normal health pool.
