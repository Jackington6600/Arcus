									<h1>The Corrupted Mines</h1>
									<p>Long taken over by nature, explore and rid an old mineshaft of <br />

								<p>You are a gang of odd-jobbers who have grown up in the Splitspear mountains, a steep region of terrain which divides the continent between the dense tropical Soderra rainforest and the much more arid Rillera region.  This area is known for its lucrative mining claims as the area is densely deposited with copper veins, a metal known for its ability to suppress magical powers.   Boom and bust towns litter the landscape, and long drop shafts and abandoned mines criss-cross the mountains in search of the next motherlode. </p>
								<p>You have been approached by an old man called Yannis who holds the deeds to one of these abandoned mines.  This one has been long taken over by nature, with a large number of parasitic vines growing over all the surfaces.  If you can escort him to the source of the vines, he can kill it and restore the mine to working order.  As a reward, you will be given a fraction of the potentially very lucrative mining claim.
