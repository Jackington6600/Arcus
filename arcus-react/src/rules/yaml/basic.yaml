      A lightweight TTRPG that focuses on swift gameplay, tactical combat, and simple yet rewarding progression.
    body: 
      - Arcus is a pen and paper tabletop role playing game (TTRPG). This system is designed for a fantasy adventure setting and draws inspiration from a wide variety of TTRPG, video game, and board game systems to deliver an expressly simple, yet versatile and powerful ruleset. Arcus' unique take on combat and abilities grants players an abundance of choices in fights and in character progression, encourages teamwork, and provides greater tactical depth. 
      - If you like games such as Divinity Original Sin 2, Baldur's Gate 3, or Gloom/Frosthaven, and wish there was a way to enjoy their fun combat systems within a simple, immersive, and flexible tabletop RPG format - this might be the game for you. If you enjoy Dungeons and Dragons 5e, Pathfinder 2e, or Draw Steel and want something a little more from combat without too much additional complexity or heroic elements - this might be the game for you.

        title: Core Dice System
        body: >-
          Arcus uses a d6 dice pool system. Always 3d6 plus some number of additional dice. Every 5 or 6 rolled counts as 1 success. The three types of dice rolls in Arcus are Challenge, Attack, and Resistance.
        children:
          - id: challenge-roll
            title: Challenge Roll
            summary: "A roll to resolve a challenging task. 3d6 plus 2 modifiers."
            body: 
              - Whenever a player or creature attempts to do something that is challenging (not trivial or impossible), the GM will ask them to roll a challenge roll. The number of dice rolled will always be 3d6 plus additional d6 equal to 2 attributes added together. Every 5 or 6 counts as 1 success. The GM will secretly decide a number of successes required (SR) to succeed, rolling a number successes equal to or greater than the SR succeeds.
              - The 2 attributes required for the roll are decided by the GM, and they may both be the same attribute. Additional dice may be added to the roll based on skills, advantages etc. Similarly, dice may be removed from the roll.
          - id: attack-roll
            title: Attack Roll
            summary: "A roll to resolve an attack and deal damage. Weapon power plus 2 modifiers."
            body: 
              - Whenever a player or creature attempts an attack, they will roll d6 equal to the attack power of the attack. The attack power will depend on the weapon or attack used, but will most commonly be Light, Medium, or Heavy (3, 6, or 9 d6) plus additional d6 equal to 2 attributes added together. Every success (5 or 6 rolled) counts as 1 damage dealt to the target of the attack.
              - The weapon or attack type will decide what attributes are used for the roll. Additional dice may be added to the roll based on skills, advantages etc. Similarly, dice may be removed from the roll.
          - id: resistance-roll
            title: Resistance Roll
            summary: "A roll to resist an incoming negative effect. 3d6 plus one energy type."
            body:
              - Whenever a player or creature is inflicted with a negative effect they may roll 3d6 plus additional d6 equal to the number of energy points they have remaining in one of the energy types required. Only 1 success is needed to successfully resist the incoming effect.
              - The energy type required is determined by the source of the effect, usually an ability description. If there are multiple energy types, the player will always get to decide which energy type they use to resist. If a player inflicts a creature with a negative condition, the player gets to choose which energy type the creature must use to attempt to resist.
      
      - id: advantage-disadvantage
        title: Advantage and Disadvantage (Adv/DisAdv)
        summary: A roll with advantage rolls up to 3 additional d6 (+), (++), or (+++). With disadvantage roll up to 3 fewer d6 (-), (--), or (---).
        body: >-
          Advantage and Disadvantage (Adv/DisAdv) can be applied to the roll to add or remove up to three (3) d6 from the number of dice rolled. Adv/DisAdv can negate each other, for example, if 2 Adv and 1 DisAdv are applied to the roll due to various circumstances for the roll, this will result in just 1 Adv, leading to 1 additional d6.
      
      - id: push-for-success
        title: Push for Success
        summary: Automatically succeed a roll which failed by 1 or 2 successes. Take a minor or major setback as a result.
        body: 
          - If a roll has failed and requires 2 or fewer additional successes to be won, a character may 'push for success'. When a character pushes for success they succeed the roll instead of failing. The GM will decide on a minor setback if the roll required 1 additional success, or a major setback if the roll required 2 additional successes. 
          - In rare cases the GM might allow a player to push for success when they fail by 3 successes, leading to a critical setback - this will often involve character death. A push for success can only be successful if the GM or a player at the table can suggest a reasonable setback.

          - At level 1, characters have 1 point in each attribute and 6 additional points to assign in any combination of attributes they choose. On every even level (2, 4, 6 etc.) characters gain 1 additional attribute point to assign in any attribute they choose.
          
          - The value of an attribute is equal to the number of additional dice rolled when making a roll that includes that attribute type. 2 attributes will be added to almost all rolls. The value will also increase energy in the corresponding type.

          - id: strength 
            title: Strength (STR)
            body: A character's physical strength and brute force. In addition to strength based rolls, strength value (STR) can be used for all melee weapons, and to reduce incoming damage with a shield.

        body:
          - Energy is a resource that can be spent by characters to use more powerful abilities, can be lost when characters suffer damage that targets those energy types, and determines the creature's ability to resist incoming negative effects. 

          - "Characters will have 3 types of Energy: Fortitude, Reflex, and Will. (FORT, REFL, and WILL)."

          - FORT is a sum of STR and CON values. REFL is a sum of DEX and PER values. WILL is a sum of INT and SPI values.

            title: Spending Energy for Abilities
            body:
              - Energy can be spent to use some more powerful abilities. When an ability is used, the creature must choose one of the energy types in the cost and spend all of the cost from that chosen type - the cost cannot be split between multiple types, even if there are multiple separate costs.

          - id: hp-energy
            title: Energy As Hit Points
            body:
              - Armour energy and shield energy are two other pools of energy - armour energy is permanent and shield energy lasts until the start of a creature's next turn. Both armour and shield energy can only act as a pool of HP and be used to resist incoming effects - they cannot be spent on using abilities. Armour energy can be regained when aan effect would cause a creature to regain energy.

              - When a creature suffers damage, energy is always lost first if possible (removing from shield energy first, then armour energy, then energy), then any remaining damage reduces the creature's HP - unless the damage type is direct damage, then it ignores energy and damages HP directly. See the Damage section for more information on how damage is dealt.

            summary: "If the creature has energy remaining, make a resist roll: 3d6 + a number of d6 equal to it's remaining energy in that type. 1 success to resist and negate the incoming negative effect."
            body:
              - "When a creature is inflicted with a negative condition, if the creature has 1 or more energy of the required type to resist the effect it may make a resist roll: 3d6 + a number of d6 equal to it's remaining energy in that type. The incoming negative effect is resisted and therefore completely negated if the creature rolls at least 1 success. However, some effects may require more successes to resist. If the creature has 0 energy in the required type it cannot attempt a resist roll."
          
      - id: hit-points
        title: Hit Points
        summary: The amount of damage a creature can suffer before it dies. 
        body:
          - At level 1 characters will have hit points (HP) equal to 6 plus 3 times their CON attribute. 2 CON would lead to 6 + 3*2 = 12 HP. HP can be fully regained on a long rest.

          - When a character's HP would reduced to 0, if it has any energy remaining (ignoring armour and shield energy) it instead falls unconscious and it's HP is set to 1 and it gains the Dying condition. If the creature has no energy remaining (ignoring armour and shield energy) is dies.

          - When any creature that is not a character is reduced to 0 HP it dies - unless the damage dealt is classed as non-lethal, in which case it falls unconscious and it's HP is set to 1.

        summary: Apply up to 3 Adv on a roll where a particular skill is applicable to the roll.
        body: 
          - Skills are specific things that a character is specially trained in - think of jobs or tasks a character might have done so often in their life that they've become proficient. These skills apply up to 3 Adv on a roll where that skill is relevant and applicable (decided by the GM).
          - "There are three degrees of skill:  Proficient (+), Expert (++), and Master (+++). 
          - At level 1 characters have 4 skill points that can either be spent to become Proficient (no higher degree) in skills, or to gain traits (see below) in any combination. Such as 3 Proficient skills and 1 trait, or even 4 traits and no skills. Skills should be discussed with the GM, as they should not be too generic or specific. Don't spend too much time worrying about this, they can always be adjusted later in play."
          - "On every odd level, a character gains 1 additional skill point to spend to either: increase the degree of skill in an existing skill, gain a new skill, or gain a new trait."

      - id: armour
        title: Armour
        body: >-
          Armour grants additional energy to a creature in a separate Armour pool, which can only be used as a form of HP and cannot be spent for casting abilities etc. Armour will reduce movement speed as a cost - most commonly: Light armour increases the armour energy by 5 and reduces 1AP movement speed by 10ft; Heavy armour increases the armour energy by 11 and reduces speed by 20ft. Both of these will be available for FORT, REFL, or WILL in various combinations. For example:
          
          **Light Armour:** 2 FORT, 2 REFL, 1 WILL. These points can be shifted in any combination that totals 5, including some being 0.
          
          **Heavy Armour:** 4 FORT, 4 REFL, 3 WILL. These points can be shifted in any combination that totals 11, including some being 0.

          Combat is hex or square grid based. 5ft per tile.
          
          **Initiative:** Highest roll/initiator of combat acts first and then clockwise around the table. GM may place 1 group of enemies between each player, if there are too many enemy groups, the remaining groups are placed after the last player to act. The initiative remains static for the rest of the fight.
          
          Alternating initiative between PCs and GM where 1 creature or player from each side takes a turn and then it is passed back to the other side. The GM decides who is going first based on who initiated the combat, if there is no clear initiator then PCs roll for REFL and if one of them gets the SR determined by the GM for this combat, the PCs may go first. If it is the PCs turn they may decide amongst them who will take that turn, after that player's turn is complete they cannot take another turn this round. Then it is the GMs turn and they will choose which creature will take their turn, and after that it is passed back to the PCs to choose who will go next, and so on.

        body: >-
          Every turn a character has 3 action points (AP) to spend on movement, attacks, spells, and so on. Attacks and damaging effects will generally always cost 2 AP to use. 1 AP movement grants 50ft of movement.
          
          Reactions will be a part of the game, only some actions can be triggered as a reaction.
      
      - id: energy-combat
        title: Energy in Combat
        body: >-
          While in combat, energy (FORT, REFL, and WILL) will be both a resource pool for casting more powerful abilities, as well as a form of hit points that will be lost when a character suffers damage. If a character has 0 left in an energy type and that energy is damaged, it will instead reduce the character's HP.
          
          At the start of each character's turn, they will regain 2 energy in any combination of one or two energy types, up to their maximum.
          
          All attacks will target one of the three energy types: FORT, REFL, or WILL. For example: think of this as using a sword to attack the torso (FORT), the limbs (REFL), or the head (WILL). The attacking characters are encouraged to describe how they formulate their attack to target the chosen energy type, to add to the thematics of combat.
          
          Equally players can describe how they avoid suffering damage to their HP pool by losing their energy instead, such as suffering damage to REFL energy to dodge an attack, or suffering damage to WILL energy to outsmart their opponent by using some spell or item in the environment to throw the attacker off balance.
      
      - id: attacks
        title: Attacks
        body: >-
          When attacking, a character will select one of the energy types to target and roll a number of d6 equal to the attack power (3, 6, or 9 for Light, Medium, or Heavy respectively) plus a number of d6 equal to 2 other attributes required for the attack (most commonly the same attribute twice). Each success (hit) will deal 1 damage to the target energy type. If the damage is greater than the number of energy points then the damage will carry over into the target's HP.

          Resistance X to damage will reduce the total damage dealt by X on every instance of damage. This will normally specify certain damage types to apply this resistance to - such as Fire Resistance 2.
          
          Vulnerability X will increase the total damage dealt by X on every instance of damage. This will normally specify certain damage types to apply this vulnerability to - such as Fire Vulnerability 2.
      
      - id: healing
        title: Healing
        body: >-
          Healing can only heal a creature's HP. However, if a creature regains HP/is healed for more HP than they are missing, any surplus healing may be gained as shield in one energy type of their choice.
      
      - id: condition-mechanics
        title: Condition Mechanics
        body: >-
          There are various conditions that will always last until the start of the source's next turn unless stated otherwise. Anything that applies a condition or immediate effect will also state which energy types must be used to resist it, such as: FORT to resist the push, or FORT or REFL (source of the condition decides which one the target must use) to resist being knocked prone. The target must roll 3d6 plus a number of d6 equal to their remaining points in that energy type (including shield, armour and energy) and require only one success to avoid the condition or effect. Therefore, you should generally aim to get an enemy's energy to 0 before attempting to apply conditions.
      
      - id: abilities
        title: Abilities
        body: >-
          There are many abilities available to the characters (and other creatures) which will attack with increased attack power, AoE, apply conditions, push and pull creatures, grant boons and additional movement, gain or transfer energy point pools, and so on. Many of these also require (or have optional) additional energy costs to be able to use them.

        title: Unconscious and Death
        body: >-
          A character will fall unconscious when it is reduced to 0HP. Other creatures will die when they reach 0HP (unless the attacker was trying to knock them unconscious). Characters that are unconscious cannot regain energy at the start of each turn. They will remain stable and only lose energy if they suffer any damage of any type.
          
          A character will die when it has 0HP and also 0 points in all 3 energy types.

          If you have a melee weapon equipped or melee attack from a core ability available when a creature moves out of melee range, you can spend your reaction to make a regular melee attack against that target immediately before they step out of range. Movement used as part of any non Core ability (such as Charge, Hit and Run, or Advance!), involuntary movement (such as being pushed or pulled), or teleportation movement does not trigger attacks of opportunity. The Move and Shift core abilities do trigger attacks of opportunity.
      
      - id: inspect-creature
        title: Inspect Creature
        body: >-
          Have the GM roughly describe a creature's strengths and weaknesses - this may require an INT+PER check (GM's discretion). This is an opportunity for the GM to give clues to the players as to what might be a good strategy to take down the enemies and what abilities they might have. Without a skill check, a player can ask the GM to describe the creature's resistance points as "exposed"/"vulnerable" if they have 0 resistance points of that type, "weak" if they have 1 point, and "strong"/"capable" if they have 2+ points. This is a key part of making sure your abilities have a good chance of taking effect on your enemies.
