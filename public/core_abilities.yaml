Without a skill check, a player can ask the GM to describe the creature’s resistance points as “exposed”/“vulnerable” if they have 0 resistance points of that type, “weak” if they have 1-3 points, and “strong”/“capable” if they have 4+ points. This is a key part of making sure your abilities have a good chance of taking effect on your enemies."
